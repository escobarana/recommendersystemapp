Developed in the UK by specialists with many years of clinical experience, the app uses easy to learn clinically proven techniques to help you live a happier, more relaxed, stress-free life.\n\nThe app helps you monitor your mood and teaches you relaxation techniques such as meditation and deep muscle relaxation that with practice have shown to help people cope better with stressful situations. It also has a 'thought trainer' programme based on cognitive behavioural therapy to help you manage those unhelpful thoughts. With no rules to use the app, you are free to jump in for 3 minutes to relax before a stressful situation or use more regularly to improve resilience and keep stress under control.\n\nHow do we know it works?\n\nWe have thousands of users worldwide. We are not trying to reinvent the wheel  - we use techniques that have been practised in hospitals and clinics for years, but in a fun, game-like format. We have a research programme in partnership with the University of Roehampton focused on continuously improving engagement and efficacy.\n\nMonitor your emotions\n\nUsing our Mood Meter you have a confidential platform to track your mood, the emotions you feel, and the situation you were in. We then help you to reframe this, thinking positively about a certain aspect of the situation and reminding you what you did on a specific day to make you feel good. By remembering what we can change rather than what we can not, we can help ourselves to control our emotional state and live happier lives!\n\nPersonalised messages, games, and more!\n\nWith our message in a bottle and wise words sessions, there are plenty of ways to interact and have fun with our app. Below are some more reasons why thousands of people are feeling the benefits of our app:\n\n- On the go: Proven therapeutic techniques available in your hands whenever you want them.\n- Easy to do: In your own time, at your own pace, with an interactive guide to help you along your journey!\n- Efficient: Improve your well-being, whether already stressed or anxious or simply for prevention and resilience.\n- Confidential: Away from stigma or judgement, and usually accessed in a quiet place, in your own time, completely anonymously!\n\nThe app is free but it is always provided in partnership with other organisations such as employers, charities or insurance companies.

Briliantly configurable.\" - James Rhodes, Pianist\n\nFeatured in The New York Times, WIRED, Engadget, Gizmodo, Product Hunt, Lifehacker, Mashable, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and more!\n\n\nPRESS MENTIONS\n\n“…Hibbert credits the app for helping cure his insomnia and diminish his postgame dependence on Ambien.” – NBA Star Roy Hibbert speaking to Sports Illustrated\n\n“That night, I nestled under my covers, downloaded the full version of Pzizz and turned it on… I was out before 20 minutes had passed and haven't looked back since.” - Jenna Wortham, New York Times\n\n“Pzizz helps you get to sleep faster and get more restful sleep with a combination of soothing sounds and voice cues aimed at helping you relax, destress, and get to sleep. In my experience, it works really well.” - Adam Pash, Lifehacker\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nUsing the latest clinical research (see our website for in-depth details), the app's patented system plays you \"dreamscapes\"— a sleep-optimized mix of music, voiceover, and sound effects that change each night, to quickly quiet your mind, put you to sleep, keep you asleep, and then wake you up feeling refreshed.\n\nIf you want to sleep better at night or take incredible power naps during the day, this is the app for you! All you have to do is listen to Pzizz. Headphones/earbuds are recommended for optimal effectiveness, but your built-in phone speaker will work too.\n\n\nNAP MODULE\n\nNapping has been proven to enhance performance, alertness, and improve your mood. Customize your naps with our specially designed nap narrations. Get rid of that groggy feeling and improve your energy levels.\n\n\nFOCUS MODULE\n\nThe focus module is music designed to help you get more work done.\n\nBuilt around ‘focuscapes,’ environments of sound that help you get in the zone and be productive, backed by the same thorough research we use to create our dreamscapes.\n\nEach focuscape has a ‘focus’ section which gets you into full concentration and a ‘cooldown’ section which brings you back out gently.\n\n\nWHAT MAKES PZIZZ SO MUCH BETTER? \n\n*Simplicity* Sleep at the push of a button! Unlike other sleep solutions, you don’t have to change your behavior, keep a sleep diary, or limit your activities. Just listen to Pzizz, and enjoy incredible sleep. \n\n*No Side Effects* Our only side effect is sleep! Unlike medications or supplements, you’ll never have to worry about adverse effects.\n\n*Variety* Every time you listen to Pzizz it creates a unique session for you. This ensures your brain doesn’t get fatigued from hearing the same things over and over again, and helps maintain effectiveness over time.\n\n*Highly customizable* Adjust sleep duration, volumes, 3D effect, and voice gender for a fully personalized listening experience. Also: integration with Apple Health!\n\n*Clinically Validated* Pzizz is incredibly effective and clinically validated.

By alerting first aid trained bystanders to local incidents, GoodSAM aims to prevent the irreparable brain and heart damage which all to frequently occurs during a cardiac arrest or traumatic incident. Opening an airway and giving basic life support can radically alter the outcome for these patients. \n\nWhen patients suffer a head injury they often stop breathing although their brain is actually not itself injured. Opening an airway and giving basic life support can radically alter the outcome for these patients. The problem has been finding people who can do this, alerting them and rapidly getting them to the patients.\n\nThere are, of course, thousands of people with such skills; off-duty doctors, nurses, police officers, first aiders are all \"Good Samaritans\" who are simply unaware of the emergency going on next door or outside their building. The Good SAM App uses the technology that can notify these people and help the person in need.\n\nWhat Are The Apps ?\n\nWe are publishing two applications; GoodSAM Alerter and GoodSAM Responder. The GoodSAM Alerter app uses locational services to track the location of a person in need of a help; after a call is triggered we know exactly where the person is located.\nOn the other hand, the GoodSAM Responder app continuously sends locational updates to our server to allow the location of volunteer doctors/first-aiders to be tracked so they can be notified of any emergencies occurring around them. For more information please refer to \"www.goodsamapp.org\".\n\nWhich Countries Are Supported ?\nOur aim is to potentially cover all the large cities around the globe.\n\nOur Apps rely on location services for navigation and position updates.

By alerting first aid trained bystanders to local incidents, GoodSAM aims to prevent the irreparable brain and heart damage which all to frequently occurs during a cardiac arrest or traumatic incident. Opening an airway and giving basic life support can radically alter the outcome for these patients. \n\nWhen patients suffer a head injury they often stop breathing although their brain is actually not itself injured. Opening an airway and giving basic life support can radically alter the outcome for these patients. The problem has been finding people who can do this, alerting them and rapidly getting them to the patients.\n\nThere are, of course, thousands of people with such skills; off-duty doctors, nurses, police officers, first aiders are all \"Good Samaritans\" who are simply unaware of the emergency going on next door or outside their building. The Good SAM App uses the technology that can notify these people and help the person in need.\n\nWho Are We?\nGood SAM is a community of people – Good Samaritans – happy to assist if they are the closest person to a medical emergency. They are trained in first aid and may have additional skills. They can maintain an airway, help stop bleeding and, if necessary, perform life saving, high quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or use a defibrillator.\nThe \"SAM\" in the name not only refers to Samaritan, but is also an acronym for “Smartphone Activated Medics”.\n\nWhat Are The Apps ?\nWe are publishing two applications; GoodSAM Alerter and GoodSAM Responder. The GoodSAM Alerter app uses locational services to track the location of a person in need of a help; after a call is triggered we know exactly where the person is located.\nOn the other hand, the GoodSAM Responder app continuously sends locational updates to our server to allow the location of volunteer doctors/first-aiders to be tracked so they can be notified of any emergencies occurring around them.

The mixing of static and dynamic splits helps you improve flexibility effectively and achieve results faster than you think.

You can customize your splits training based on your own preferences, no equipment needed.\n\nWhether you want to do a full split for dance, ballet, gymnastics or martial arts, this training will help you get there.\n\nWhy splits?\nSplits have been proven to prevent injuries, increase muscle strength, relieve muscle stiffness and give you better circulation.\n\nImprove your flexibility & balance\nFlexibility and balance are key to reducing the risk of injury during exercise. Splits stretch all your lower body muscles to increase your range of motion.\n\nLoosen your hip flexors\nDue to sitting at a desk all day, most people have extremely tight hip flexors, which can cause pain, especially in your lower back. Splits open up these areas to relieve your muscle tension.\n\nDeeply stretch your legs\nWhen doing splits, your legs will be stretching the whole time. Doctors will recommend splits as part of your exercise routine, especially if you’re doing activities such as running or biking.\n\nBoost your circulation\nSplits lengthen your muscles and improve your circulation by increasing blood flow to your muscles.\n\nPlease get your muscles warmed up before doing the splits. Splits need time; your muscles need time to stretch, recover and adapt to the new demands. Be patient, and stick to it; you’ll soon see progress.\n\nFeatures\n- Splits for all levels, splits for beginners, splits for men, splits for women, splits for kids\n- Step-by-step directions on how to do the splits for all levels\n- Effective formula to help achieve results fast\n- Splits in 30 days\n- Customize your own training plan\n- Easy-to-follow instruction, animation and video guide\n- Record your progress automatically\n- Stretches for splits target all muscles you need to become super flexible\n- Sync data to Apple Health\n\nTry this app if you want stretches for splits, splits training for beginners, splits in 30 days, splits in a week, splits for beginners, splits for kids, splits for men, splits training for kids, flexibility training, flexibility stretches, how to do the splits, dynamic stretching, stretching exercises for flexibility, flexibility training, warm up exercises, stretching routines, stretch for runners, do the splits, do the splits in 30 days...","developer":"ABISHKKING LIMITED.","developerUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/developer/abishkking-limited/id896501517?uo=2","developerId":"896501517?uo=2","genre":"Health & Fitness","genreId":"6013","released":"2019-09-05T00:00:00-07:00"},{"id":"1438092960","appId":"com.fitcoach","title":"FitCoach: Fitness at home","icon":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/55/82/d7/5582d77e-f5ae-ce00-4b83-3010400278ab/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-0-10-0-0-85-220.png/100x100bb.png","url":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/fitcoach-fitness-at-home/id1438092960?uo=2","price":0,"currency":"GBP","free":true,"description":"WORKOUTS FOR WOMEN TO LOSE WEIGHT\n► Smart training plans\n► Visible results\n► Guided exercises\n\nFitCoach is a brand-new fitness app for women who want to start a new active lifestyle, build healthy habits, lose weight, get fit, tone up and feel amazing.\n\nWHO IS THIS APP FOR?\n\nThe FitCoach app is developed specifically for women who care about their health and want to slim down and get in shape but don’t have enough time to go to the gym.\n\nHOW TO START WITH FITCOACH?\n\nSet your goals: weight loss, muscle gain, or to be more active\nSelect the zone that you want to work on: belly, buttocks, legs, arms, back\nEnter your personal data such as age, height, weight, fitness level, etc.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK:\n\nAccording to your goals and personal data, our smart algorithm will suggest a personalized workout plan – a combination of cardio, strength, recovery, and LISS (walking, running, cycling) exercises that will enable you to maximize your results. \n\nThe basic plan will be created for 60 days and displayed in your calendar.

Myzone also offers amongst the most precise calorie-crunch data on the market, plus the ability to effectively calculate cardio and weight training.\n\nMyzone uniquely rewards effort, while providing a game based platform and social experience that is both inclusive and engaging to all, regardless of athletic ability. As the name suggests, its technology creates bespoke and responsive targets for each individual, to provide personal feedback – hence ‘Myzone’.\nCreating a personal handicap based on your maximum heart rate, it is possible to beat an elite athlete by simply working harder. For example, you might finish behind an elite athlete in an endurance run, but exert greater effort and Myzone makes you the winner – so everyone competes on a level playing field.\n\nMyzone encourages competition with other users through cloud-based challenges via a web-based account and bespoke app. The community aspect of Myzone makes it a Facebook for physical activity. Users can analyze, ‘like’, and comment on each other’s workouts, while the app logs your activity history and even updates you over email. In fact, this is the only system to recognize and notify you when you have attained the World Health Organization’s recommended guidelines for physical activity.\nThe Myzone App allows you to sync your Myzone MZ-3 Physical Activity Belt with your phone meaning you can now see live data and upload stored workouts on your phone. If you prefer to use your MZ-3 with third party fitness apps then your data will still be stored (up to 16 hours) until you sync with your Myzone® app. \n\nThis app integrates with many other platforms, including Apple Health. If you grant permission, we will save your activity calories, height, weight, BMI, BMR and body fat data to Apple Health.\n\n**** Please note that the app will only work if you have a Myzone® Account (you can create an account in the app for free if you don’t have one already) and your tile will only be shown and data uploaded if you have the new Myzone® MZ-3 Physical Activity Belt.”","icon":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/f5/08/af/f508af86-a62b-c053-d1e1-30b3bf3d92c0/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6013"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["AR","EN","FR","DE","IT","JA","KO","PL","PT","RU","ZH","ES","SV","TH","ZH"],"size":"163406848","requiredOsVersion":"10.0","released":"2015-05-17T05:11:15Z","updated":"2020-03-30T08:53:34Z","releaseNotes":"2.31.0\n- A new status view has been added to the top of the activity feed.\n- You can now delete comments on your moves, and delete comments that you have posted on other people's moves.\n- Move comments now appear before likes when viewing a move, avoiding having to scroll past a potentially long list of likes to get to the comments section.\n- You can now delete your workouts from the app, should you wish to.\n- MZ-Bodyscans can now be viewed in portrait mode.\n- You can now quickly select all months when syncing detailed MZ-Motion data.\n- Preset praise options have been added to easily congratulate someone for reaching a higher status.\n- 'Virtual Class' is no longer used in place of a profile image in the booking diary when a coach isn't specified.\n- The photo cropping UI has been updated when zooming into an image in an MZChat, or the inbox.","version":"2.31.0","price":0,"currency":"GBP","free":true,"developerId":549797901,"developer":"MYZONE (Worldwide) Ltd.","developerUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/developer/myzone-worldwide-ltd/id549797901?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.myzone.org","score":4.67533,"reviews":3770,"currentVersionScore":4.67533,"currentVersionReviews":3770,"screenshots":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/02/db/16/02db162d-7f84-e066-7d57-57570a156420/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/1c/55/3a/1c553a87-28c3-81b9-1d7a-e5139ab2e47d/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/a8/51/2c/a8512c18-185f-98b8-55d6-f39b34c3104d/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/c7/7b/c1/c77bc1d2-d553-96ba-e58f-bc2bdfb8dc37/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPad76-iPad76","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPad812-iPad812","iPad75-iPad75","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPad73-iPad73","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPhone5c-iPhone5c","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular","iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPad611-iPad611","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPad71-iPad71","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPad612-iPad612","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G","iPhone5-iPhone5","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPad856-iPad856","iPad74-iPad74","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPad834-iPad834","iPad72-iPad72","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPad878-iPad878","Watch4-Watch4","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"]},{"id":990154592,"appId":"au.com.headjam.balanced","title":"Balanced","url":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/balanced/id990154592?uo=4","description":"There are lots of apps out there, but only one Balanced.

This is a quick and easy way to understand if your heart health is better or worse than it should be for someone of your age. \n\nMEASURE WHAT MATTERS\nIt’s not the number of steps that count, but how much heart you put into it. That’s why PAI counts all activity - as long as it gets your body moving and your heart pumping. PAI works for all fitness levels too as it’s personalized to your unique makeup. \n\nLearn more about PAI Health at www.paihealth.com.","icon":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/aa/cb/16/aacb16a7-ccf6-1c5c-b4cb-e4800dd8e030/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6013"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"18713600","requiredOsVersion":"11.0","released":"2020-01-13T08:00:00Z","updated":"2020-04-03T00:33:16Z","releaseNotes":"- Bug Fixes\n- Performance Increases\n- Accessibility Increases","version":"1.2.0","price":0,"currency":"GBP","free":true,"developerId":1450296086,"developer":"PAI Health Inc.","developerUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/developer/pai-health-inc/id1450296086?uo=4","score":4,"reviews":4,"currentVersionScore":4,"currentVersionReviews":4,"screenshots":["https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/f1/df/31/f1df31ec-5cea-b0f9-d752-a3851e7d0a27/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/d3/e0/a1/d3e0a150-5dcf-7567-dbf5-6f052bdb29b7/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/e4/14/5b/e4145b7d-e8aa-529a-a536-7a0534f8eb15/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/2e/e3/df/2ee3dfeb-ff41-6dbd-e907-8521f6b37ce8/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/4a/2c/98/4a2c98f1-30ed-6092-a6c2-ae2c581ff279/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/1a/3e/6e/1a3e6e2d-74f8-6aed-bc19-1a949be2c303/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPad76-iPad76","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPad812-iPad812","iPad75-iPad75","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPad73-iPad73","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPad611-iPad611","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPad71-iPad71","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPad612-iPad612","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPad856-iPad856","iPad74-iPad74","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPad834-iPad834","iPad72-iPad72","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPad878-iPad878","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"]},{"id":899948362,"appId":"com.alutechhk.gofitness","title":"Go Fitness","url":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/go-fitness/id899948362?uo=4","description":"Go Fitness app allows you to measure your heart rate and speed/cadence performance with the aid of Go Fitness Bluetooth Smart sensors; which can let you to keep track your record to reach your traning and fitness goals. \n\nHow to connect your Bluetooth Smart hardware for measurement \nBluetooth Smart enabled devices include the iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C, iPod Touch 5th generation, iPad 3rd & 4th generation and iPad mini. \nUse Go Fitness app to connect your Bluetooth Smart hardware including heart rate monitors and speed/cadence sensors. \n\nHow Go Fitness apps support the users \nGo Fitness apps can show the following data with the corresponding sensors connected to the Bluetooth Smart Ready devices. \n1.

This was our focus; it was the next time we would be together, though sadly it never happened. Julie and I both believe that ‘Angel Sara’ will be there in Paris to meet all who are involved in this event.\n\nOur pilgrimage to bring alive that memory is the basis of ‘Meet you in Paris’. We will travel from Australia to London Bridge to the Eiffel Tower, travelling for eight days by bicycle to the Eiffel Tower, Paris. Throughout our journey we will be carrying our personal letter of hope to be delivered to the people of France. \n\nPlease join us to bring our community and our world together to share unconditional love for all that we have in life.\n\nYours Sincerely\nMark & Julie Wallace”\n\n\nAny questions or feedback?

This App has been extensively validated compared to traditional paper versions tools (more info below)  \n\nThe Interactive Clinics App itself will not share your pain level entry with third parties. Therefore, no one else will have access to your pain level data. \n\n\n—— FUNCTIONALITY ——\n\n\t• Interactive Clinics App is also designed to potentially connect with a website called https://interactiveclinics.com which may provide further meaningful information regarding your exercise level captured while using your iWatch\n\n\t• If you may wish to share your 'pain level' and 'physical activity information' please contact your personal-trainer or allied health professional for more information. This functionality will only be enabled if you consent to link the App with the interactiveclinics.com. In order to link with interactiveclinics.com, please ask your personal-trainer or allied health professional to provide you with the unique '6 digits codes' that needs to be inserted in the 'Link Module' Tab of the App\n\n\n—— PAIN LEVEL ——\n\n\t• Pain Level has been usually recorded by filling the paper Visual Analogue Scale (pVAS) that consists of a 10cm straight line, where 0 represent NO pain and 10 equates to the 'worst possible pain'. Traditionally, the user is simply asked to draw a dot with a pen on the paper line. The value obtained provides an overview of the person's current pain level. The pVAS is a free tool used on a daily basis by health professionals. pVAS been extensively validated as an appropriate outcome measures for assessing pain with children, adolescents and adult. More information about the traditional paper VAS can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale\n\n\t• Our team has developed a modern version of the pVAS, called: electronic Visual Analogue Scale (eVAS). The functionality of the Interactive Clinics App enables the user to capture the pain level directly using the eVAS. On the eVAS a horizontal line is displayed over a white background where the user can insert the level of pain: 0=no pain, 10= worst possible pain. Once the information has been entered, the user can press 'continue' and the App will automatically display a number (ranging from 0 to 10, for example 5.2)\n\n\t• Our research team has successfully conducted a large cross-sectional study comparing the pVAS with the eVAS showing excellent reliability and repeatability compared to the traditional pVAS. In addition, our protocol has also been published and it is publicly available directly on https://www.protocols.io/view/comparison-of-paper-and-electronic-visual-analogue-rrxd57n\n\n\n—— PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ——\n\nThe Interactive Clinics app integrates with Health App and uses HealthKit API's in order to get your physical activity data through your iWatch. It will show your progress in an easy way and will motivate you to achieve your goals.\n\n\n—— NOTES ——\n\n\t• The Interactive Clinics App does NOT provide a medical interpretation of the value recorded in the Pain Level Module\n\t• The Interactive Clinics App itself will NOT provide any type of direct or indirect doctor consultation or any medical related health advice. Also, it does not provide any medical reports that can inform or misinform the users in any aspect of their health\n\t• The Interactive Clinics App itself does NOT provide or share any information with any doctor or anyone else regarding the user progress of any outcome. Only if the user consents to connect with the interactiveclinics.com, then a possible personal-trainer or allied health professional may observe the information that the user willingly decided to share. The personal-trainer or allied health professional can potentially send a short text via push-notification with the aim to motivate the user to meet the daily exercise target\n\nEnjoy!","icon":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/e8/05/d1/e805d125-c17b-9079-5c3e-402562778277/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Medical"],"genreIds":["6013","6020"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"14609408","requiredOsVersion":"9.0","released":"2018-08-09T02:34:10Z","updated":"2019-09-19T00:46:52Z","releaseNotes":"Enjoy connecting your smartwatch with this version and follow up your fitness progression!\nFixed a connectivity bug, physical activity data bug and improved app performance.","version":"1.1.1","price":0,"currency":"GBP","free":true,"developerId":940121093,"developer":"Bit Genoma Digital Solutions SL","developerUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/developer/bit-genoma-digital-solutions-sl/id940121093?uo=4","score":0,"reviews":0,"currentVersionScore":0,"currentVersionReviews":0,"screenshots":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/3f/a1/da/3fa1daa6-b0b9-df3e-0bdc-8d5e218b420c/mzl.obfxoepa.png/392x696bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/30/f6/02/30f6023d-a422-841a-5208-24c8f2c856e1/mzl.gvhquxhj.png/392x696bb.png","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/37/de/ae/37deaea3-aedd-7cde-0a4e-e14ad25531e0/mzl.bdzdlwwm.png/392x696bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/39/07/c3/3907c337-6346-17ea-f493-f168c675b012/mzl.xhbcjrjj.png/392x696bb.png","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/01/a4/60/01a460d4-43cb-4c83-8d22-8bd24043bc00/mzl.xxjapdqu.png/392x696bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/f5/3f/85/f53f85f6-cba4-99a7-7f88-31ee2680380e/mzl.yfpuvqcl.png/392x696bb.png"],"ipadScreenshots":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/70/d3/47/70d347ea-39f4-6bce-c6b7-356c6830e649/mzl.ynxymtph.png/576x768bb.png","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/15/44/51/1544514c-745c-b84c-ddb4-a4b2209835cf/mzl.hpvcutdf.png/576x768bb.png","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/fc/7f/a3/fc7fa36e-71f5-cd34-db62-a40d960c7720/mzl.okvokrzd.png/576x768bb.png","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/2a/52/ca/2a52ca8e-588a-5bdd-6d3d-75629aa094fd/mzl.bfszcdjg.png/576x768bb.png","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/c4/6b/06/c46b063a-01fb-12ce-fe86-7af28880e6a5/mzl.bxodhfjg.png/576x768bb.png","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/be/dc/11/bedc116d-4002-eca0-5b47-8d0cb8b7f6b8/mzl.hmokiado.png/576x768bb.png"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPad76-iPad76","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPad812-iPad812","iPad75-iPad75","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPad73-iPad73","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPhone5c-iPhone5c","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular","iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax","iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi","iPad611-iPad611","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPad71-iPad71","Watch5-Watch5","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPad612-iPad612","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G","iPhone5-iPhone5","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","iPadMini-iPadMini","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPad23G-iPad23G","iPad856-iPad856","iPad74-iPad74","iPhone4S-iPhone4S","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPad834-iPad834","iPad72-iPad72","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPad878-iPad878","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","Watch4-Watch4","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"]},{"id":1439031023,"appId":"com.hinteenx.xperthealth","title":"XpertHealth","url":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/xperthealth/id1439031023?uo=4","description":"With the XpertHealth app you can conveniently track all your activities.

Programėlės aprašymas lietuvių kalba - apačioje\n\nMotionity is an app that motivates you to be physically active every day. Your goal is to collect at least ten Motionity activity points each day by walking, running, biking or doing many other types of physical activity. By doing so you will improve your health, strengthen your muscles and may even extend your life expectancy as much as 4 years!\n\nWhy did we create Motionity?\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, approximately 3.2 million deaths each year are attributable to insufficient physical activity. Health professionals argue that insufficient levels of physical activity increase the risk of chronic diseases (for example, cancer) and may even lead to a premature death. \n\nMotionity was created to help you to understand whether you are sufficiently physically active every day. Motionity provides you with an easy-to-understand information about your daily physical activity levels and motivates you to be more physically active, if needed.\n\nWhat makes Motionity special?\n\nFirst, Motionity takes into account your physical characteristics while assessing your daily physical activity levels. It is obvious, that a 30-minute walk at a brisk pace is a tough task for some, whereas for others it may be just an another daily thing. For this reason, Motionity, unlike other apps, does not just blindly sum your daily steps. On the contrary - it calculates a relative intensity of each of your daily physical activity events by taking into account your age, sex, height and weight. In this way, you are provided with an accurate and personalized information about your daily physical activity levels.\n\nSecond, Motionity does not use a GPS signal. Unlike other similar apps, instead of using GPS Motionity employs the hardware of your phone to make all the calculations it needs. Thus, Motionity not only ensures your privacy but also saves your phone battery from draining.\n\nThird, Motionity may help you save up to $500. Motionity detects your physical activity as accurately as most smart watches or smart bands on the market, provided that you carry the phone with you. The main difference - Motionity is free! \n\nWe hope that Motionity will help you to become more active, healthier and live longer!\n\nNote. Motionity gets information about your physical activity from a special processor in your mobile phone. After receiving your approval, Motionity receives this information (also known as 'Motion&Fitness' data) and transforms it into the data about your physical activity. Motionity gets information about your physical characteristics (your age, height, sex and weight) directly from you or, after receiving your approval, from the Health app on your phone. The main goal of Motionity is to provide you with an accurate and easy-to-understand information about your daily physical activity levels. However, please take note that Motionity is a tool for information purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. Motionity is intended as a self-help tool so you should contact your health care provider or emergency services if needed.\n\n\n***\n\nLietuviškai:\n\n„Motionity“ - tai mobilioji programėlė, kurios pagalba galite stebėti, ar pakankamai fiziškai judate kiekvieną dieną. Jūsų tikslas - kasdien surinkti bent 10-imt „Motionity“ aktyvumo balų, žyminčių, kad pasiekėte minimalų savo užsibrėžtą kasdienio fizinio judėjimo tikslą. Kasdien surinkdami bent 10-imt „Motionity“ aktyvumo balų tapsite sveikesni ir, anot mokslininkų, savo gyvenimą galite prailginti net iki 4-ių metų!\n\nTam, kad nereikėtų skaičiuoti kiekvieno žingsnio, sukūrėme „Motionity“, kuri jums padės akimirksniu suprasti, ar pakankamai fiziškai judate. Jei dienos pabaigoje nebūsite pasiekę savo užsibrėžto fizinio judėjimo tikslo, „Motionity“ rekomenduos kiek laiko jums dar reikia fiziškai judėti iki pasieksite savo fizinio judėjimo tikslą.\n\nTikimės, kad su „Motionity“ pagalba tapsite sveikesni, žvalesni ir energingesni!","icon":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/df/59/cc/df59ccae-15ee-c16b-26a9-d8ffb1ea8106/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6013"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN","LT"],"size":"23676928","requiredOsVersion":"12.0","released":"2018-11-09T02:22:50Z","updated":"2019-01-04T05:07:44Z","releaseNotes":"In this version: \n• Up to 50% faster analysis of your physical activities;\n• New access to the detailed information about your previous days' results;\n• More accurate and consistent analysis of your physical activities when you change time zones;\n• Many other small fixes.\n\nŠioje versijoje:\n• Iki 50% greitesnis duomenų užkrovimas nustatant jūsų kasdienio judėjimo lygį;\n• Galimybė peržiūrėti detalius jūsų ankstesnių dienų judėjimo rezultatus;\n• Tikslesnis ir nuoseklesnis jūsų kasdienio judėjimo lygio nustatymas tais atvejais, kai keliaujate iš vienos laiko juostos į kitą;\n• Daug kitų smulkių pataisymų ir patobulinimų.","version":"1.2","price":0,"currency":"GBP","free":true,"developerId":1435714606,"developer":"Tomas Bekisas","developerUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/developer/tomas-bekisas/id1435714606?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.motionity.eu/en/","score":0,"reviews":0,"currentVersionScore":0,"currentVersionReviews":0,"screenshots":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/23/ac/3c/23ac3c2d-eefb-5e3a-7604-832704469c35/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/71/87/a8/7187a8f5-e786-b479-45b6-d48856fe2317/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/53/d5/1d/53d51d26-4c8e-b93f-67f6-7b8f34df1084/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/0c/2a/78/0c2a7834-b5ae-8152-b845-10d797eef6bb/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/65/9d/62/659d62e5-f571-32d5-1e18-5aa8ffc92664/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/b5/ce/a9/b5cea9bc-3b76-b541-1dfe-b38ee230e0f3/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPad76-iPad76","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPad812-iPad812","iPad75-iPad75","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPad73-iPad73","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPad611-iPad611","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPad71-iPad71","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPad612-iPad612","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPad856-iPad856","iPad74-iPad74","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPad834-iPad834","iPad72-iPad72","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPad878-iPad878","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"]},{"id":1343239838,"appId":"com.kiskolabs.muuvit.adventure","title":"Muuvit Adventure","url":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/muuvit-adventure/id1343239838?uo=4","description":"Muuvit combines technology, with physical activity and learning, encouraging cultural diversity, integration and collaboration.\n\nThe Muuvit Adventure app counts your steps and automatically and adds them to your class account.

Earn Move Minutes for all of your activity and get motivated to make small, healthier changes throughout your day, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or catching up with a friend over a walk instead of a coffee.\r\n\r\n • Heart Points\r\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity, like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30 minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity, which is shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental well-being.\r\n\r\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\r\n\r\nTRACK YOUR WORKOUTS FROM YOUR PHONE OR WATCH\r\nGet instant insights when you exercise and see real-time stats for your runs, walks, and bike rides.

The mixing of static and dynamic planks really helps you burn fat fast. Take only 7 minutes a day to burn calories and get in better shape!\r\n\r\nWith 3 difficulty levels, the 30-day weight loss plan perfectly fits all fitness levels, and it suits both men and women. You can customize your training plan according to your own preferences. There's no equipment or gym needed; you can do plank workouts anywhere at anytime.\r\n\r\nWhy plank workout?\r\nPlanks are the most popular and effective fat burning exercise. They can be easily performed and activate all your muscles, including your core, shoulders, glutes, etc. Planks are the best choice for people with weak knees because they put no pressure on knees.\r\n\r\nMaximize the belly fat burning: Planks are more effective than crunches at burning belly fat. Planks activate 100% of your abs, while crunches only involve 64% of them.\r\n\r\nStrengthen your core: Plank workout fires up all your core muscle groups, enhances your core strength, and helps you get a strong core.\r\n\r\nReduce back pain: Plank workout can strengthen your back muscles, reduce back pain and lower the risk of back and spinal column injuries.\r\n\r\nImprove your posture & balance: Plank workout requires your head, back and feet to be in a straight line. Regularly doing this will improve your balance and posture when sitting and standing.\r\n\r\nAccelerate your metabolism: Doing planks keeps your metabolism high for the whole day; this dramatically boosts the fat burning process.\r\n\r\nImprove your flexibility: Plank workout stretches all your posterior muscle groups, such as your shoulder blades, glutes and hamstrings, thus improving your flexibility and lowering the risk of injury.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Different forms of planks provided\r\n- Customized workout reminders help you make planking a daily workout routine\r\n- Detailed instruction, animation, and video guide you through every workout\r\n- Workout duration and difficulty increase step by step\r\n- Track your weight loss progress automatically\r\n- Track your burned calories automatically","descriptionHTML":"This app provides different plank variations to help you lose weight, gain strength and get a <b>stronger core</b>.

However, keep in mind that many factors can influence the heart rate, including Activity level, Fitness level,  Body size, Emotion, etc. Generally, a lower heartbeat at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness.\r\n\r\nConsult your doctor if your resting heartbeat is consistently above 100 beats per minute or if you're not a trained athlete and your resting heartbeat is below 60 beats a minute\r\n\r\nWhat are heart rate training zones?\r\n\r\nHeart rate training zones are calculated using maximum heart Rate (MaxHR). Within each training zone, subtle physiological effects take place to enhance your fitness. We have a similar definition to those used in Fitbit trackers:\r\n\r\n- REST ZONE (up to 50% HRmax): This considers as resting zone.\r\n\r\n- FAT BURN ZONE (50 to 70% of maximum): Recovery and warming up exercises should be completed in this zone. It’s called the fat burn zone because a higher percentage of calories are burnt from fat.\r\n\r\n- CARDIO ZONE (70% to 85% of HRmax): Most of the main exercise should be completed in this zone.\r\n\r\n- PEAK ZONE (greater than 85% of HRmax): This zone is ideal for short intense sessions (high-intensity interval training HIIT) to improve performance and speed.\r\n\r\nThis heart rate monitor app calculates and automatically saves your heart rate training zones.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n- Heart rate monitor app should not be used as a medical device.\r\n- In some devices, heart rate monitor may make the LED flash very hot.","descriptionHTML":"Heart rate or heartbeat is an important measure in health and fitness.

Within each training zone, subtle physiological effects take place to enhance your fitness. We have a similar definition to those used in Fitbit trackers:<br><br>- REST ZONE (up to 50% HRmax): This considers as resting zone.<br><br>- FAT BURN ZONE (50 to 70% of maximum): Recovery and warming up exercises should be completed in this zone. It’s called the fat burn zone because a higher percentage of calories are burnt from fat.<br><br>- CARDIO ZONE (70% to 85% of HRmax): Most of the main exercise should be completed in this zone.<br><br>- PEAK ZONE (greater than 85% of HRmax): This zone is ideal for short intense sessions (high-intensity interval training HIIT) to improve performance and speed.<br><br>This heart rate monitor app calculates and automatically saves your heart rate training zones.<br><br><br><b>NOTES</b><br><br>- Heart rate monitor app should not be used as a medical device.<br>- In some devices, heart rate monitor may make the LED flash very hot.","summary":"The simplest yet the most accurate app to monitor your heart rate!","installs":"1,000,000+","minInstalls":1000000,"score":4.4920855,"scoreText":"4.5","ratings":36231,"reviews":13718,"histogram":{"1":1931,"2":392,"3":1378,"4":6741,"5":25787},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"2.3M","androidVersion":"4.0","androidVersionText":"4.0 and up","developer":"REPS","developerId":"REPS","developerEmail":"repsiapp@gmail.com","developerAddress":"Oxford University Innovation\nBuxton Court\n3 West Way\nOxford\nOX2 0JB\nUK","privacyPolicy":"http://repsiventure.blogspot.co.uk/2017/05/accurate-heart-rate-monitor-privacy.html","developerInternalID":"4918947122054461343","genre":"Health & Fitness","genreId":"HEALTH_AND_FITNESS","icon":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/93k8lMlBkujwBo_Ykjrm923Sgigl9VOBpJbGCMrsZkJ6Zd7ufHUyF89VtTfPOnaQUPSy","headerImage":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1NZ_L6B0c7ky0qMSBcrMpCZsFfU8RFed-WxM1MOZmAjV9X5V-WkOfu1C4pU6h_2YMSWM","screenshots":["https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SULV07yIr5SWKMUMIuE2D2j_com8V8Zz6Qv3MCToYFLLBHsxVMmRKl2CiEG6yG4VxMQK","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JkxC1v6ZI3rT-LoYGiXQR5mKkVTP0lyCwwSC5jKXhvr4yW4ol1VVYTt8k_p7iaRkmy4","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WGp0jEIRFFkaewbxTQ9uiSqHL55wV0SZmcx68uxnGJ0ljjaA1ZFrOaWkiOEHUZ7nc3w","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I05OY8E7AaJsow_vtZR2Cv5IqBOJTEnB5U1ZBBLSR1xbU6_pivbcQI3rI9q3gr27mg4","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TCS-DQXHYO7hJOmNikM2mwX91ZsLy0RXxxTYJT5MbuQ5XwyhT-2s8llNKQyGbJQuKLPK","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4r2cCUr1nbHFbPqoxIe6YDTvCRQtPBfGcOPGZJjSuxTJaGOVFmUR_WThbBGvdHkd0Ug","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FS-DSFq52DuYe2Ix9NUq71pS_c5A6trImSct-yaZHK3JnKSPC83NNv6-yd1flZXZBwU","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tnbI_AtuAZaPg2QXZZnLQsyL0GL89b93EOPHdrtHir08gdVq7w98UaxYXLuy9L8fD7k"],"contentRating":"PEGI 3","adSupported":true,"released":"Jan 31, 2016","updated":1496226310000,"version":"3.4","recentChanges":"Bug fixes!","comments":[],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.repsi.heartrate","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.repsi.heartrate&hl=en&gl=gb"},{"title":"Deep Meditate - Meditation, Relaxation, Sleep App","description":"Life can be stressful, but meditation isn't.

(Free)","description":"Get ready for the run of your life. Join 5 million runners on an epic adventure!\r\n\r\nYou tie your shoes, put on your headphones, take your first steps outside. You’ve barely covered 100 yards when you hear them. They must be close. You can hear every guttural breath, every rattling groan - they’re everywhere. Zombies. There’s only one thing you can do: Run!\r\n\r\nZombies, Run! is an ultra-immersive running game and audio adventure, co-created with award-winning novelist Naomi Alderman. Every run becomes a mission where you’re the hero, with our immersive audio drama putting you at the centre of your very own zombie adventure story. While you run to the perfect mix of heart-pumping audio drama and pulse-pounding songs from your own playlist, you’ll collect supplies to grow your base back home. \r\n\r\nBBC NEWS - “The only way to save yourself is to run for real.”\r\nWIRED - “In the style of Runkeeper, with an exciting undead twist.”\r\nLIFEHACKER - “A really cool way to get outside and exercise.”\r\nCNN - “Turns exercise into a game - a terrifying, terrifying game.”\r\nTIME - \"Takes all the fun of a zombie game and funnels it into a fitness app.\"\r\n\r\nWALK, JOG, OR RUN ANYWHERE\r\nZombies, Run! works anywhere and at any speed. You can jog in a park, run along a beach, or walk along a trail. It even works on treadmills! \r\n\r\nYOU ARE RUNNER 5 \r\nHundreds of lives are counting on you. You’ve got to rebuild your base from a few shivering survivors into a fortified beacon of civilization by collecting critical supplies and avoiding roving zombie hordes. Can you save them and learn the truth about the zombie apocalypse?\r\n\r\nA WORLD OF STORIES\r\nYou become the hero in an epic story of humanity’s struggle for survival where your running *really* matters, and there’s a deeper mystery to be uncovered as well. Play the first four missions for free and unlock one extra mission every week. \r\n\r\nJOIN THE ABEL RUNNER'S CLUB\r\nUnlock all 300+ story missions immediately for unlimited play, plus Interval Training and Airdrop Mode. Membership is available for $5.99 USD/month or $34.99 USD/year. Your subscription will automatically renew. (Existing paid players will have access to a special discounted membership rate, plus free access to all game modes and S1-3 missions).\r\n\r\nYOUR OWN MIX\r\nChoose your own custom playlists before you start running: the story unfolds in between your tracks through a series of dynamic radio messages and voice recordings.\r\n\r\nZOMBIES CHASES\r\nSaving the world not exciting enough? Activate Chases to kick things up a notch. When you hear zombies on your six, it’s time to speed up before they get too close. Can you escape every mob, or will you have to drop some of your hard-earned supplies to distract them? There’s only one way to find out.\r\n\r\nDETAILED STATS\r\nView detailed graphs and stats for your entire running and game progress — and check out which songs you play the most while escaping zombies!\r\n\r\nKEEP THE SURVIVORS ALIVE\r\nEvery time you run, you’ll automatically collect vital supplies like medicine, batteries and food. Once you’re home, you can use them to build your very own post-apocalypse community. Do you strengthen your defences against the zombies, or build a new farm?

You can hear every guttural breath, every rattling groan - they’re everywhere. Zombies. There’s only one thing you can do: Run!<br><br>Zombies, Run! is an ultra-immersive running game and audio adventure, co-created with award-winning novelist Naomi Alderman. Every run becomes a mission where you’re the hero, with our immersive audio drama putting you at the centre of your very own zombie adventure story. While you run to the perfect mix of heart-pumping audio drama and pulse-pounding songs from your own playlist, you’ll collect supplies to grow your base back home. <br><br>BBC NEWS - “The only way to save yourself is to run for real.”<br>WIRED - “In the style of Runkeeper, with an exciting undead twist.”<br>LIFEHACKER - “A really cool way to get outside and exercise.”<br>CNN - “Turns exercise into a game - a terrifying, terrifying game.”<br>TIME - &quot;Takes all the fun of a zombie game and funnels it into a fitness app.&quot;<br><br>WALK, JOG, OR RUN ANYWHERE<br>Zombies, Run! works anywhere and at any speed. You can jog in a park, run along a beach, or walk along a trail. It even works on treadmills! <br><br>YOU ARE RUNNER 5 <br>Hundreds of lives are counting on you. You’ve got to rebuild your base from a few shivering survivors into a fortified beacon of civilization by collecting critical supplies and avoiding roving zombie hordes. Can you save them and learn the truth about the zombie apocalypse?<br><br>A WORLD OF STORIES<br>You become the hero in an epic story of humanity’s struggle for survival where your running *really* matters, and there’s a deeper mystery to be uncovered as well. Play the first four missions for free and unlock one extra mission every week. <br><br>JOIN THE ABEL RUNNER&#39;S CLUB<br>Unlock all 300+ story missions immediately for unlimited play, plus Interval Training and Airdrop Mode. Membership is available for $5.99 USD/month or $34.99 USD/year. Your subscription will automatically renew. (Existing paid players will have access to a special discounted membership rate, plus free access to all game modes and S1-3 missions).<br><br>YOUR OWN MIX<br>Choose your own custom playlists before you start running: the story unfolds in between your tracks through a series of dynamic radio messages and voice recordings.<br><br>ZOMBIES CHASES<br>Saving the world not exciting enough? Activate Chases to kick things up a notch. When you hear zombies on your six, it’s time to speed up before they get too close. Can you escape every mob, or will you have to drop some of your hard-earned supplies to distract them? There’s only one way to find out.<br><br>DETAILED STATS<br>View detailed graphs and stats for your entire running and game progress — and check out which songs you play the most while escaping zombies!<br><br>KEEP THE SURVIVORS ALIVE<br>Every time you run, you’ll automatically collect vital supplies like medicine, batteries and food. Once you’re home, you can use them to build your very own post-apocalypse community. Do you strengthen your defences against the zombies, or build a new farm?

I don't have Pro and won't pay for ads to be removed.

I don't know why it thinks that a back workout can only be pushups and absolutely nothing else. I really also don't like that I chose a bodyweight only program and it's trying to give me dumbbell exercises. I wish there was an option to switch out single workout days with something in the same category.","I am in love with this app. I was never a regular exerciser and in past I tried several other apps but couldn't find them motivational or interesting. This app has a great way of exercising like there is a background music which is the best thing. Secondly, the lady who instructs and counts, and finally that whistle which reminds me of my childhood sports days. Literally, now I am a premium KEEP member and I have also installed the keep yoga app which is also good but needs somemore improvement.","At first I was turned off by the subscription requirement. Then, I realized I get coins everyday just for completing exercise programs or interacting with the app. That means I can purchase those programs with no issues. I really appreciate that since I just wanted to try the app out. Also, they start you off with like 200 coins. If it works really well over the next couple or months, I will probably subscribe and cancel my gym lol","App is good, phone app at least. I am a bit annoyed by the voice-over counting the seconds, but that's not why I'm giving it a 4-star. I have issues with TV app: first, no way to change music and second, there are sync issues (plan accessible on phone but not on TV) I would consider buying it, but bad TV app is a downer. Basically, I am confined to watching the exercises on the small phone screen placed near the exercise mat - not the best setup. Web app maybe?","I have tried lots of workout apps from play store and none of them gave me satisfaction till I luckily found Keep Trainer. This is the best workout trainer app. All the exercises are very good and the best part is that we can get them free of cost and without any ads.

Great for someone who enjoys using minimal equipment while keeping the intensity high. I like how each workout is multiple parts (1.5m cardio followed by lifting circuit followed by abs, etc). I usually have to abbreviate the workouts down to 2 to 3 rounds for length, but I prefer having to cut a workout down rather than crummy 20 minute workouts that don't do much for me.

Usefull for advanced as well as beginners. There are some problems though. 1- The app interface is very strange mostly aimed at securing the content from being copied so distracting and frustrating for user. 2- Even after applying filter you have to open each and every thumbnail to find what is inside. Except for these two structural flaws the app is deserved to be Number one.","Worth the wait and the robot voice. Good detail and description and the graphics are greatly appreciated! Great for those with and without anatomy background. Helpful. Would be great if education was free but the 3 year package seems like a good deal to me.","So far I like what I see.

Apparently in the last 3 days I haven't walked .... at all!!! I have a horse and pony so am constantly walking and have my phone on me all the time. I just tried walking briskly, as its recorded previously, but nothing. The little man is walking but nothing being recorded. Really disappointed.","I do like this app. As I write this we are in lockdown & I work from home anyway but it does serve as a motivator for me to get out of the house & get some exercise, especially as it helps me to get out of the pre diabetes category. I do like to check & see how I hsve done & it certainly helps to give me a nudge to get out & be active. Well done. 😁","It can be useful, but is so often inaccurate that I now can't trust what it says. There are many times when I have had my phone in my pocket and the info on how long I've been walking and/or walking briskly is either massively under or over what it actually was. This isn't down to me under or over estimating what I've done, as it is often exactly the same walk which I know how long it takes me to do when I'm walking fast.","Brilliant app if you want to start your journey to fitness, especially after illness or injury. Can start with 10 minutes of walking no set pace, distance but after a few days can see improvement both recorded on app and from ease now walking. Will look at increasing time but no pressure from app to do so.","I've used Active 10 before, but stopped when it didn't seem to work accurately on an earlier phone. Well, now I am on a Google Pixel 3A and it works great. Some might say it isn't right that it counts all brisk walking against your target rather than just 10 continuous minutes, but for me it has actively encouraged me to pick up my pace whenever I can, even when just walking around the office. The upshot is I aim for 150 brisk minutes per week and achieve it.

Within the last week the gps has stopped working. It is anywhere from .2 to 3 miles off. After tracking, the app also freezes and I have to force the app to stop and then open it back up. I have uninstalled and re-installed several times but that didn't help. I contacted their support team via email and was basically told, thanks for letting us know but we aren't going to look into the issue.","After updating yesterday I have found it missed out parts of my walk and done so three times today, usually very good app. Also connected to MapMyFitness and it keeps duplicating the workouts. 28th March not syncing my workouts or sometimes even recording them, 29th March try to sync it comes up with error can can't resubmit or refresh pain in the backside, we all need to use this app in these worrying times.","This app worked great. The announcement of each mile in my headphones motivated me to keep going to get to the next and without looking I had no idea how far I was. I actually went longer and farther then I intended just waiting to be told the next mile marker. I'm going to recommend this app to all my walking friends.","The App worked absolutely well for me, but the last few days it's been getting \"stuck\" or hanging AND unable to stop the Clock at the end of Workout! In my Workout today, as was the day before, it recorded wrong time and Calories burnt during workout! My other wish is if it could work offline sometimes AND NOT be so internet reliant, permitting saving of current and previous workout data and starting a NEW workout whilst offline! Many a time we workout in 'offgrid areas'.🤔","UA record was way better than this, app wouldn't let me make an account with my email kept crashing, finally logged in with my facebook to an old account and it won't link with myfitnesspal then the dang thing keeps crashing saying there is no account associated with my facebook even after I am logged in.

It is a good app just that sometimes the reminders don't work. ---- Overall its good, i have been looking for something like that, used it for less than a week and considering purchasing except that the food counters forces you to key a value to each and it doesn't saved the food for the next use. Like if I drink the same milk everyday I have to manually key it in everyday. So I love it but I am not quite sure this is what I need for now.","Am I missing something? How can an app have logs and goals for activity and calories burned but no way to look at history of your progress except scaling though one day at a time. Seems basic to me. The same way that weight is shown, should also be available for activity and other metrics. Reallly short sighted, literally. Doesnt look like it is in Premoum either. If I am missing something, let me know.","Health Pal Fitness has everything a beginner or pro may need. I just downloaded it and so far it has all the trackers I need: steps, water, bmi, calisthenics anywhere, calories...I will update later with usage. So far so good. 😍","Amazing app for those who want to get on track, but you cant customize it to your perfection. For example, if you dont eat lunch and you want to just lean on other meals, you cant just turn it off. Also, it's a little overwhelming for me. There is too much to keep track of, and it seems you spend more time adjusting and tracking things on the app than spending time in the real world actually doing the things it tells you to do. The best app ever, but has some major downsides.","I thought this app was going to be absolutely amazing, a one stop shop for all my health needs. Then I went walking with my phone in hand only to realize that I had to start it first, meaning it hadn't been keeping my steps throughout the day. No big deal. Once I turned on the session to start my walk,it automatically started counting and I wasn't even moving. I got up to 84 steps counted without moving anything other than my arms.

The only improvement this app could make would be allowing exercises to count for more than one muscle group.","Awesome! I've tried multiple workout apps. This is, hands down the best I've found. You can search exercise by muscle group, and has a decent number of base exercises to pull from. Also having the ability to create new exercises and group them into any of the muscle group categories. Being able to copy old workouts on the calender really saves time.

On your app when I add 'walking' or (swimming/yoga) to the exercises, I can't complete the entry due to mileage/time (instead of reps, etc.) Is there a fix I do not see that's available?

Though they are imperfect and i have some suggestions pertaining to that. My main gripe is that there isn't a good structure form for swimming laps. I haven't seen much change in the app since i downloaded it. I would highly respect a suggestion forum of some sort and updates with progress. Very good app could be exceptional with updates.","I really like this app for all the reason all the other reviews have mentioned.

The only way (that I've found so far) of reconnecting is by factory resetting my watch, losing my data in the process... Which defeats the point of having a smart watch. I'm very disappointed.","Been using Withings for a few years now. App is easy to use and gives good information quickly. I have Smart Scales, Blood Pressure Cuff, and Steel HR watch. I also have the speed tracker which I'm not sure I trust though. Apparently I have never snored! Only think I would change is to make it possible to selectively send work out sessions to Strava (rather than all automatically).","I really like this fitness tracker. It does quite a bit more. Like the sleep tracker and the alarms. Just have to remember to turn off the notifications at times. The battery life is a month! Which is fantastic! I probably will upgrade with this brand. Worked great helping with my fitness goals.","The app is nice enough but sleep does not track if less than 3 hours which never tracks an hour nap and misses my actual bedtime if I happen to be restless an get up after 2 hours and try an hour later. As well, the watch only tracks walking if your watch arm is swinging which it does not do when carrying bags or pushing a stroller or pulling a sleigh. I work hard for my steps and half do not count."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.withings.wiscale2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.withings.wiscale2&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Men's Health Fitness Trainer - Workout & Training","description":"The Men’s Health Fitness Trainer supports and motivates you to effectively reach your personal fitness target.

So easy to navigate and use, a well thought out and developed App. I have told everyone I know about it. If I had one thing to add, which I hate to sound like I am moaning, is there is no cardio section. But all in all the best App I have seen.","Really great so much better than the other 8 I looked at. Easy to use and setup. Can make your own sets, reps, and weight. A huge list of exercises to choose from. Been a life saver to keep up my training while in lockdown. Highly recommend. If I have one fought is to remove the BMI garbage. Putting in height and weight and giving the big red obese sign isn't pleasant. I powerlift","I purchased a home gym setup awhile ago. I stopped using it because I wasn't getting what I wanted out of it. Then I found this app and I'm excited about working out again! I was amazed at all the things I can do with what I have! I definitely recommend this to anyone who is into lifting, beginners or vets. Great job with the app devs, keep up the great work!","Great app for routines! Packed with preprogrammed routines for you to follow or exercises to build your own routine. Easy to follow and log progress and keep focused with a rest countdown. Why I dropped a star: I'd like to see what my start, max and average weights are per exercise so I know what I'm aiming for. More graphs: weight over time for a certain exercise would be great. Ability to log that I did a one-off exercise without having to add it to a workout. No way to pay to remove ads?!","It's a great app with great features! Would definitely recommend! The only reason it isn't a 5 star is because I believe more bodyweight exercises should be added. Resistant band exercises should be added as well. This way more people would be attracted to getting the app because not everyone works out with weights or dumbbells. I use resistant bands during my travels and would love to see them on here so I can get a full workout with them."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"adam.exercisedictionary","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=adam.exercisedictionary&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Cardio workout: Home Cardio Trainer, Training app","description":"Are you having problem with your daily routine…. ?.Here comes Cardio workout: Home Cardio Trainer, Training app with the best exercises plan.

Excellent for newbies in the weight training world learning how to do the exercises correctly. Cons: After paying for the app, I was disappointed it didn't give you things others apps give you for free such as... -You can't input weight amount you're currently lifting during the exercise plans -No timer during resting periods -You can't swap out exercises unless you do custom Could improved a lot more.","I haven't used an app like this before.

I do exercise at the gym. I do cardio and weights, zumba, and yoga. Also I had done small group hard training in the past. This app exercises are like having a personal trainer. You challenge yourself each day. I end up work out tire after each session. I'm on my 8th day.","I like the timing and the combination of exercises. My only challenge is likely a glitch in the system. Sometimes, the exercise you just finished might be shown as the next exercise. But after the countdown, something different shows up. So, you're noot prepared in such cases. Other than that, I think the app is perfect.","This app is realy well put together. I've used it a lot and it shows fast resalts. You won't be disappointed. The app is good for beginners and those who have more a bit more experience as well I recommend this for anyone under any circumstances because it is so worth it.!👍💜","Eventhough short time, you feel like forever to finish one round. Pumping up your heart rate and strengthen your core. You will sweat a lot after 1 round. It also requires you to rest once every 3 days unlike other apps will encourage you to do it everyday without rest. Do this after cardio. Love this very much","This is a really good app. I've seen good results from it. Just 2 problems that I've experienced: 1. It won't let me reset the workout. I've already completed the 30 days and now I can't do it again because it won't allow me to reset the app. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but no luck. 2. It keeps saying 7 days remaining (the 7 rest days) so it doesn't actually let you know you've completed 30 days; is there any way to fix this on the app?"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bwf.hiit.workout.abs.challenge.home.fitness","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bwf.hiit.workout.abs.challenge.home.fitness&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Pro Home Workouts – No Equipment - Workout at home","description":"Pro Home Workout is your Home Workouts trainer.

I am going to upgrade for some curated routines. Best feature are 3 second videos for each excercise. Just one click in the routine list. Its GUI, great videos/ demo makes trying a new excercise easy and accessible. Suggestion: please plug into myfitnesspal!!!

More than 85 percent of all people around the world will experience lower back pain (Lumbar herniated disc, etc.) at some point in their life, and it is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Yet surgery or painkiller are rarely needed to treat lower back pain. So, what’s the answer?\r\n\r\nA typical response to experiencing lower back pain is to take it easy - either staying in bed or at least stopping any activity that is at all strenuous. While this approach is understandable and may even be recommended in the short term, when done for more than a day or two it can actually undermine healing. Instead, active forms of back exercises are almost always necessary to rehabilitate the spine and help alleviate lower back pain.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the best medicine for dealing with lower back pain is EXERCISE! Studies confirm that when lower back pain sufferers start a regular exercise program, they are more likely to have less pain, and be able to return to work and be active again.\r\n\r\nThe set of exercises presented in this app are suitable for people suffering from lower back pain (Lumbar herniated disc, etc.). At first you probably will not be able to do it like it’s shown in the app, but that's normal, do not despair and keep going day by day. And don’t do the mistake trying to do too much too soon. Always leave time for warm-up and cool-down before and after workouts for lower back pain. \r\n\r\nThe end positions of every exercise could be a bit painful. Please, do not overwhelm your back and stop when feeling medium to strong pain. It is recommended to do the exercises in the morning when the back is stiff, but it can be done when it is convenient.

It must not be considered as medical advice.","descriptionHTML":"Did you know that the lower back pain is the most common reason for seeing a doctor in the World? More than 85 percent of all people around the world will experience lower back pain (Lumbar herniated disc, etc.) at some point in their life, and it is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Yet surgery or painkiller are rarely needed to treat lower back pain. So, what’s the answer?<br><br>A typical response to experiencing lower back pain is to take it easy - either staying in bed or at least stopping any activity that is at all strenuous. While this approach is understandable and may even be recommended in the short term, when done for more than a day or two it can actually undermine healing. Instead, active forms of back exercises are almost always necessary to rehabilitate the spine and help alleviate lower back pain.<br><br>That being said, the best medicine for dealing with lower back pain is EXERCISE! Studies confirm that when lower back pain sufferers start a regular exercise program, they are more likely to have less pain, and be able to return to work and be active again.<br><br>The set of exercises presented in this app are suitable for people suffering from lower back pain (Lumbar herniated disc, etc.). At first you probably will not be able to do it like it’s shown in the app, but that&#39;s normal, do not despair and keep going day by day. And don’t do the mistake trying to do too much too soon. Always leave time for warm-up and cool-down before and after workouts for lower back pain. <br><br>The end positions of every exercise could be a bit painful. Please, do not overwhelm your back and stop when feeling medium to strong pain. It is recommended to do the exercises in the morning when the back is stiff, but it can be done when it is convenient. They can also be done 2-3 times a day.<br><br><b>Note:<br>If you are having serious lower back pain, please use the content only in consultation with an appropriate certified medical or healthcare professional.

After using the heart monitor I found out I was actually under achieving. I love the stats it collects and I can access on my phone. My progress is shown on the tv monitor at the gym and I can compare/compete with others. For only the one time investment of the heart monitor there is no other charge. I love it. Please join in.","The overall myzone concept is a good one, the execution is lacking. One of the those I've talked to using the system is the lack of trimming the workout. Once the belt detects it is on the workout begins. However, if you are still warming or preparing to start, that is a lot of wasted time being accounted for in the summary. There should be a way to trim the workout after the fact or at least indicate a stary/end with the app real time. Overall, we found the quality of the belt and device poor.","Connection problems, tried on three different devices,(one brand new with only myzone downloaded) constantly drops connection having to clear phone and restart app, tried with phone different locations same problems, device fully charged same problems. Very hard for me to reach over 90% HR but sometimes device jumps to 90+% then 50+% its not static from clothing as I exercise without shirt. Would be great if they had a dedicated receiver you could plug into phone if it guaranteed connection.","The app's good - you wouldn't want to use MyZone without it. But it's a bit buggy (it was esp so on my Huawei, when I used that phone). And I think it could do with some minor tweaks for everyday things like saving pictures (pixellation in particular), workout descriptions (e.g. giving you more space to name stuff and allowing you to edit already saved descriptions rather than wiping their fields clear). A few major enhancements could also do, if not an outright upgrade to include HRV (a biggy).","I love the app and the personalization. I think it's a great motivator and accountability tool. The only reason I haven't rated it 5 stars is because it take a little while to update MEPS. So then a workout is completed it doesn't automatically update you to let you know what your sitting at in challenges and for the week and month."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.myzone.myzoneble","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myzone.myzoneble&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Yoga For Kids - NB Fits","description":"Workout keep physically healthy kids and also are more likely to be academically motivated, alert, and successful.

I absolutely love the possibility to place exercises in groups, the interface is beautiful and easy to use. Just so pretty and intuitive! However, I would really like to unlock the premium features, but why would I take a subscription? If you chose a different business model I'd be prepared to pay 5$ for this and simply don't understand how a utility app choses to monetize as a subscription. I would also appreciate a web interface, so I can create and edit workouts behind my PC","Thank goodness for this app. I had downloaded about 10 apps, none of which did what I want. I wanted multiple exercise notifications before a rest - that's all. This is the first I downloaded that was customizable enough to give me the workout I wanted. I haven't tried it in practice yet but so far it looks good. I did check to make sure my Spotify playlist would play at the same time and it does, but the workout notifications may be too quiet when on. I'll have to see when I try it for real.","Love this app! I tried to contact via the email but never got an answer, so writing feedback here: 1. Bug: When I skip an exercise the Time Left counter doesn't update. 2. Pay for lifetime. I'd love to pay a one time fee. I hate recurring payments. Usually pay is 3 years in other apps. 3. Ability to save groups outside workouts to reuse them accross many workouts. If you update a group, all workouts using the group update. 4. Be able to move a group into another group or workout. Thanks!","Fantastic app! It took about 30 minutes to figure out. It was confusing at first. But once I figured it out I loved it. I use it for a strength training routine but it should work for anything from yoga to HITT. Before I would always forget how many sets I had done. I love the fact that I can change the amount of time for each exercise. I love the fact that it is tied to the voice reading app on my phone and so it calls out each exercise. Probably couldn't do this in a gym setting.","Does exactly what I wanted it to. I think what would make it even better is if it had an exercise database and you can use those exercises to create your own workout but it is still very very good if you know what exercises you already want to use.

Also, pay for steps is initially good but then as you approach the $10 cash out amount, you'll receive less than a penny. My cash rewards for yesterday were literally \"$0.0001\". Don't waste your time, just do a real cash app or walking app, if that's what you're really looking for.","Dont waste your time! You constantly have to earn energy just to try to get puzzle pieces but end up with more energy. When you do get a puzzle piece it's the same one over and over for the same activity so somehow you have 16 different activities to do and pieces to get in order to get a $100 gift card. It goes in circles and there is no way to do it that I can see. Save some time and don't download! The concept was great but the whole thing sucks when you realize you cant actually get pieces!","The ads are very misleading. It leads you to believe that it operates in a way similar to Sweatcoin (and said that 100 steps equals $1) but there is no way to \"redeem\" steps. In addition, it's FULL of ads. Every time you even click on something, you can expect an ad to pop up. Personally, I would rate this zero stars if I could. The ads causes glitches, and even if you decline watching an ad to double your earnings, it still makes you watch an ad.","I have been using this app for almost a month now. This app is my least fun part of my day. There are so many ads. Every time you do anything, you have to watch an ad. You have to earn puzzle pieces from walking, but if you don't get the one you need from walking, you have the chance to get one from one of three games. I'm not getting any puzzle pieces for the Amazon gift card anymore, and I just need one more. Now, this is a walking app, and it enforces time on the phone, not walking. A scam.","When I down loaded the game the ad specifically said 100 steps= $1. So I decided to try it. They actually gave $1 for every 1,000 steps. And when I complained to the developer they made it literally pennies. When I explained to them that I was a health care worker and every step counts in my field they gave me fractions of a penny. Not even a full cent! I have had issues with the puzzle pieces but they have fixed that. I only have 2 more puzzel pieces left to go before I get $100 Amazon gift"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"pro.health.steptracker.pedometer.free","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pro.health.steptracker.pedometer.free&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Yoga for Beginners – Daily Yoga Workout at Home","description":"Are you a beginner to yoga?

My complaint is that it needs a reset option, or an option to go back levels, as even uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't reset progress. Used this app during pregnancy, and now don't necessarily want to resume at the same level. Would love the option to slow it down and move back levels to build back up","I am working on my pelvic floor with my physical therapist and she was thrilled when I told her about this app. She is going to recommend it to her patients. It is helpful to talk to someone to make sure you are doing them correctly. I was not at first. Remember to breath out as you do the kegels to get better contractions.","I wish you could reset the app. If I miss a few days of training, it just continues like nothing happened. And the trick is to exercise everyday to keep it consistent. It should have a feature that let's me reset which day/intensity I am on in case I ever miss a day. Otherwise, I open the app after a month and it just assumes I'm still as strong as I was before. Make sense?","Awesome app with a few minor nags. The first is the notification system. If I dont have the app open and running in the background at all times then I won't receive my daily notification to do the exercises. The second is the graph/information system. I'd like more detailed breakdowns on my exercise duration times by the day, and it would also be great to know how many sessions are left before the next level for motivation. Once these issues are addressed I'd give it 5 stars.","Really loving the simplicity and effectiveness of this app and the exercises. At first I thought it works you up to over an hour a day (which felt very overwhelming) but once I started using it I realised it refers to total minutes per level. The only thing I would like to see is how many minutes/seconds each day's exercise is. The graph sort of shows you but not accurately. Other than that it's perfect.

We can go as crazy (or lazy) as we want with times we cook and ingredients we use, the app is also really easy to navigate. I don't use the workout plan since I already have my own, but a family member uses it and he loves it. Price is extremely affordable if you choose not to use the free version. It saves us hundreds of $$ a month on going out to eat. My average cost of meal is $2.00 a meal! That's it!","The free version of the app is great, considering upgrading too. The meal tracking is the beat I've seen and the fact that even the free version can generate a daily meal plan is great. One thing I'd change: when adding an off-plan meal, you can click on a Recent item and open/edit it. That would be nice, especially if it was a longer named meal.","Great meal planner that adheres to special diets that's macro-centric rather than calorie-centric. The computer generation is great as it personalizes recipes for you, but I found it sometimes makes things more confusing by splitting up a recipie into weird fractions (5/12 of a ramen block?). If you're aware of that, you can plan accordingly for leftover ingredients, etc.","I love this app/online resource. Batching groceries is a super awesome option, as is having recipes that take multiple days into account for meal prep. I had some issues at first with meal selection (I use macros) but then I read the advice about pinning meals and having the generator build around them. This is amazing. Thank you!","Here's the deal. Every app that has a trial, they let you try it for the given days and after the trial is done, you then get charged. This app charges upfront and the full price. If you don't like it, Google refunds guidelines states that they won't refund it, that you must get the refund from the company/developer directly. So far, I cancelled the same day because it wasn't what it thought, and no refund yet."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.strongrfastr.cordova","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.strongrfastr.cordova&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Progression Workout Tracker","description":"Fitness tracking made simple, and beautiful.

The main thing is I wish that the app would allow me to share my workout schedule with a friend so they can use the same schedule, not just export your workout data. Another small thing would be to take in account your heartrate and bodyweight for calories burned. Overall pretty decent","I've been a fitness buff for decades. Just used this app for the first time. It has room for improvement of course, but it's incredibly amazing in many other way. Needs more bodyweight cardio exercises. Love how it has a shortcut that takes me right to my music player. Immediately syncs to Google Fit after your workout. Totally customizable workouts and fitness schedules.

I have a lot of mental diagnosis including bipolar but this would work amazing for anyone needed help managing or monitoring the symptoms of depression in general. The app is able to track your sleep time, work time, and time on social media. It's easy to use, and very self explanatory. It also creates a really light-hearted comfortable safe place to self express. You can even invite your doctor to view your progress!","It's a great app for getting a baseline, but I would like to have the ability to edit the daily mood descriptors (fine, happy, etc) to better suit me. The biggest complaint I have is not being able to add warning signs myself. Just because my mood hasn't changed dramatically doesn't mean I don't identity a warning sign I want to track.","i couldn't even get past the sign up. you have to create a username and password, then it ask for your location with google maps. every time i try to search for my home it immediately crashes and takes me to step one. id be happy to actually use the app once this is fixed somehow.","I dont know what it is, but seeing my emotions on a graph helps. I see how much sleep I get, how long I'm at school, and social app times. The only thing that's a bit flawed is the fitness feature. It apparently thinks that I've been exercising when I'm watching tv on my couch lol","Overall very good but small things like the time tracking, particularly for sleep, can get to be so off they're practically useless.

The descriptions of how to do a move and how many sets is great. Plus a video that shows you what it should look like is dope!! Level 1 is perfect for someone extremely out of shape such as myself. I'm excited to work myself up to the a level 4 and see my results. Good luck on your journey 🤗","It's so hard to find a workout app that scales intensity for beginners, but this one is perfect. Each exercise is just the right length so that when I think \"oh no I can't do any more\" I do one more and it's a rest period. I also want to say thank you for not flashing annoying UPGRADE TO PREMIUM ads all over. Most health and fitness apps want a $100/year subscription these days and that is insane. THANK YOU!","first workout-- really good. Easy to follow and I feel energized. Each exercise was different (I really appreciated that). I encourage everyone to try it. I gave it a four because I want to try it for a month-- and will adjust the rating accordingly up or down.","1st day, great workout...I'm still catching my breath even though they were short sets that I could manage. I just had 2 babies back to back and I'm carrying 30 extra pounds. This is a good way to get my fitness back on track. You can handle almost any workout for 30 seconds each.","Video won't download. I have done one workout which was decent. However even on that day i couldn't do the workouts i wanted because it just kept saying can't download. I'm again trying to do another workout and the free ones won't download.

Would be nice to have all your stats transfer over. 2. You should be able to create your own workout like in BodySpace from individual exercises.","Great interface and content! But I ran into a very annoying bug/issue with this app. I currently am on the \"Blood & Guts\" 6 week trainer with Dorian Yates. All my workouts have been successfully logged EXCEPT Leg Day workouts. I am on the 5th week of the program and I cannot see what my Leg Day workout was from the previous 4 weeks! I can see all the previous workouts (Chest & Biceps Day, Back Day, etc.). Because of this bug, essentially what I do on Leg Day is trying to recall what last week's weights were and go from there. Again, I cannot see the history for Leg Day. I am inputting the weights and reps correctly. Can someone reach out and let me know what to do or what can be done?","This app has went down horribly. Why isn't that i can't search for exercises like before? Where's the search button? Why do i have to go into a web browser to find the excercises that i want. On top of that i cant even add them. What the hell am i paying for then? Where are all the at home excercises via app?","$13 a month for a personal trainer, so to speak, isn't a bad deal. Lots of plans to help if you're finding it hard to progress forward or achieve goals. As a former personal trainer it's ok to seek others for assistance when you start to plateau. The side notes for nutrition and supplementation are helpful as well. Currently doing Jim Stoppanis 12-week program, and two weeks in, I'm glad it's helping me get over that hurdle","This is a must-have companion for my Bodybuilding Lifestyle. I enjoy the thoroughly explained workouts, variety of programs and its always a bonus to have a good meal and supplement plan that's provided on most programs and always different!

Outside of this basic functionality however, everything is locked behind a paywall and never relents on conveying to the user that they need to cough up the dough in order to access the vast majority of the app's functionality. Think EA but for working out.","I've been using this app for a month or two now and really like it. The layout is great, the flexibility with making your own exercises is great, and the customer service is awesome! Giving only 4 stars because you can't enter more than 5 sets per exercise, can't have more than 3 exercises in a superset, and you can't measure a set for distance. Aside from those I love the app!","Looks good, but need gym for weight machines and need to pay because very little is free. Need a free version and home workout with body weight and dumbbells only.","Awesome app. Lots of possibilities. Love the map that shows how the buddy is ready or not for a new session of workout.","Used this for over 12 months and simply put, it's one of the best I've used.
