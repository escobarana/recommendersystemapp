It never repeats, it has top-notch sounds, and it is just plain fun to use.\" - Cult Of Mac.\n‣ \"We've covered many online noise generators in the past, but myNoise® is different: it calibrates background noise based on your hearing range and listening devices.\" - Lifehacker.\n\nmyNoise® is free, with White Noise, Rain Noise, Ocean Noise, Binaural Beats, Spring Walk, Temple Bells, Tibetan Choir and Warp Speed, the ultimate white noise machine for Sci-Fi fans.\n\nThe idea behind a noise machine, is to make use of the noises you like to mask the noises you dislike. The concept is simple, works extremely well, and does not require expensive equipment, such as active noise cancelling headphones.\n\nNoise machines can be used in a variety of ways throughout your daily lives, and can be used by all audiences. They can not only help you focus while working in a noisy environment or help to settle your anxiety, but they are also useful in cases of insomnia or tinnitus. Fortunately, you don't need a specific reason to start listening to myNoise®!\n\nCompared to conventional noise blocking machines, myNoise® generators can be shaped to the frequency characteristics of the audible nuisance that disturbs you, and therefore achieve a better camouflage, or - in other words - a greater masking efficiency at quieter levels. myNoise® will cover background noises whether you're trying to work, study, relax, or sleep.\n\nListening to our sound generators in a quiet environment makes sense too, and is even recommended to enjoy their optimal sound quality. Let them become your best friend when it comes to soothing babies at bedtime, or during your meditation and relaxation sessions.\n\nSome of our noises are truly special: our so-called calibrated noise generators cover the entire audible frequency range, from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, over 10 color-coded octaves. Thanks to our unique calibration procedure, each calibrated generator can be made spectrally flat to your ears. As we get older, we all suffer from age-related hearing loss involving the higher tones. During the calibration procedure, we are able to measure your personal hearing levels, and adapt our calibrated noises - such as the rain noise - accordingly. You'll be surprised to hear frequencies you thought were lost forever! \n\nCalibrated noise generators also compensate for your audio equipment and listening environment deficiencies, including the presence of background noise and its nature.\n\nWe regularly add new generators that you can find in the Download tab. Check them out, some of them are free to download. If you are a noise enthusiast, purchasing the \"All You Can Hear\" package guarantees that you will get unlimited access to all generators, including future ones. There are more than 150 generators available for download today, including 40+ calibrated ones.

Want to hear a campfire in the rain? How about a washing machine and a dryer? It's all possible with the Mixer. Save your favorite sound combinations. Your custom mixes are synchronized between all of your iOS devices with iCloud.\n\nFADE-OUT TIMER: Set Rain Rain to gently fade out and then turn off after a specified duration so that you can get to sleep without leaving your phone or tablet on all night. The Fade-out Timer learns your preferences and automatically starts the next time you use Rain Rain.\n\nBEDTIME REMINDER: The first step to a better night's sleep is a healthy sleep schedule. Get to bed on-time with Rain Rain's Bedtime Reminder by setting the time and days you want a reminder. Rain Rain sends you a gentle, encouraging message when it is time to go to bed so that you can get the rest you deserve.\n\nOSCILLATOR: Customize your experience with the Oscillator, which slowly fades a sound in and out, allowing you to create dynamic, varying soundscapes in concert with the Mixer. You can even adjust how fast the Oscillator changes the volume. When you save a Mix to your Favorites, your Oscillator settings are saved as well, allowing you to save and recall any number of custom soundscapes.\n\nSOFTEN: Adjust the tone of each sound to suit your needs with Soften, which reduces the high frequencies of any sound by an amount you choose. This makes the sound seem as if it is coming from another room or outside, as sometimes you want to sleep with rain outside, not pouring on your head. Soften takes care of any worries about the sound being harsh, tinny, or hissy when played on small speakers or even the built-in iPhone or iPad speakers. Your chosen levels for Soften are stored when you save a Mix to your Favorites to help you create the perfect scenes.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.rainrainapp.com/tou\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.rainrainapp.com/privacy\n\nDownload Rain Rain today and get a better night's sleep tonight!","developer":"Tim Gostony","developerUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/developer/tim-gostony/id360071874?uo=2","developerId":"360071874?uo=2","genre":"Health & Fitness","genreId":"6013","released":"2011-11-11T20:07:24-07:00"},{"id":"823305987","appId":"com.oneothergame.7min-fatburn","title":"Weight Loss Workout by 7M Apps","icon":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/2e/89/75/2e897529-c139-e01f-51e0-652ff308c80d/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-7-0-0-sRGB-0-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-85-220-0-0.png/100x100bb.png","url":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/weight-loss-workout-by-7m-apps/id823305987?uo=2","price":0,"currency":"GBP","free":true,"description":"Burn fat fast with Weight Loss by 7M.

Expect frequent updates with more of the top athletes and coaches joining the mix!   \n\nIt’s So Simple\nWe’ve taken a fresh approach to the typical timer, and made one that’s clean, crisp and clear.  We know you probably have sweat (or blood) in your eye, and reading a clock that’s not well laid out might be a nightmare.  The PushPress Timer has a big, bold display, highly contrasting colors and very easy to understand-at-a-glance interface.  Stop wasting time trying to tell how far into a workout you are, and keep on moving that weight!\n\nA Free Gym Clock\nPair this app with your TV (using an Apple TV) and WHAM! You got yourself an instant massive, kick a** clock for your gym to use for workouts.  Forget that old analog beeping clock from the 1980’s - put up a big ol’ TV in your gym and run this clock off of it.  Use that TV when you’re not running a class to show YouTube videos of Klokov snatching mad weight… or use it to show Barney re-runs to the kids.  Either way, it’s a massive upgrade to your space, something your clients will appreciate.\n\n** Even though we really really love us some functional fitness (and own a couple boxes ourselves), The PushPress Timer is not affiliated with CrossFit, Inc., The CrossFit Games, or any other property owned by CrossFit, Inc.

Cancer is one of the biggest causes of premature death worldwide, finding answers and treatments through medical research is vital and DreamLab gives ordinary people the extraordinary chance to save lives. DreamLab exists to help find answers quicker and the more people who use DreamLab, the faster it works.\n\nMedical research currently generates huge volumes of health data around the world every day, but access to computing power to crunch and make sense of this data is limited. Your mobile device contains a huge amount of computing power needed to run everything from email to music and video streaming apps, but is mostly dormant while you plug it in to charge overnight. DreamLab harnesses this processing power, of yours and thousands of other mobile phones, to examine such health data to look specifically at how existing drugs can be repurposed to help in the fight against cancer.\n \nDreamLab taps into this invaluable resource to find more effective combinations of drugs that can be tailored to patients to improve treatments and save lives. As a Dreamer, you can even choose which type of cancer research to support - breast, ovarian, prostate or pancreatic - and also select how much mobile data the app uses every month. Just one PC running 24 hours a day would need 300 years to process the data required to complete the project. However, 100,000 smartphones running DreamLab for six hours a night could fast track the job in just three months.\n \nDownload the DreamLab app today and start making a difference to lives in the fight against cancer.\n \nCharge\nDownload the DreamLab app, choose a project to support and each time your phone is plugged in, charged and connected to the internet, you’ll be helping to save lives in the fight against cancer.\n \nSleep\nCharge your phone overnight and while you #SleepLikeAHero, DreamLab taps into its unused processing power to support vital cancer research.\n \nFight Cancer\nAlongside thousands of other DreamLab users, while you sleep you’ll be using your phone to power a virtual supercomputer, capable of processing billions of calculations – and helping fast track research into better ways to fight cancer.\n \nWhen you plug your phone in and power DreamLab, it downloads tiny parts of a huge research project from the cloud to calculate and sends the results back to the team at Imperial College London. The more people who power DreamLab, the faster we can find the right drugs and treatments to beat cancer. All you need to do is set up DreamLab once and it will get to work each time you plug your phone in and power DreamLab.\n\nWe’ve all been touched by cancer. Our best chance of beating it is by working together. To help the fight against cancer and find the drugs and treatments needed to fight it, simply download the app (#) and choose which Project you’d like to support. You can also track the contribution you’ve made and keep up to date with news.\n\nDreamLab supports cancer research globally and is powered by the Vodafone Foundation.\n \nhttps://www.vodafone.co.uk/dreamlab/\n \n* A compatible handset is required.

Briliantly configurable.\" - James Rhodes, Pianist\n\nFeatured in The New York Times, WIRED, Engadget, Gizmodo, Product Hunt, Lifehacker, Mashable, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and more!\n\n\nPRESS MENTIONS\n\n“…Hibbert credits the app for helping cure his insomnia and diminish his postgame dependence on Ambien.” – NBA Star Roy Hibbert speaking to Sports Illustrated\n\n“That night, I nestled under my covers, downloaded the full version of Pzizz and turned it on… I was out before 20 minutes had passed and haven't looked back since.” - Jenna Wortham, New York Times\n\n“Pzizz helps you get to sleep faster and get more restful sleep with a combination of soothing sounds and voice cues aimed at helping you relax, destress, and get to sleep. In my experience, it works really well.” - Adam Pash, Lifehacker\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nUsing the latest clinical research (see our website for in-depth details), the app's patented system plays you \"dreamscapes\"— a sleep-optimized mix of music, voiceover, and sound effects that change each night, to quickly quiet your mind, put you to sleep, keep you asleep, and then wake you up feeling refreshed.\n\nIf you want to sleep better at night or take incredible power naps during the day, this is the app for you! All you have to do is listen to Pzizz. Headphones/earbuds are recommended for optimal effectiveness, but your built-in phone speaker will work too.\n\n\nNAP MODULE\n\nNapping has been proven to enhance performance, alertness, and improve your mood. Customize your naps with our specially designed nap narrations. Get rid of that groggy feeling and improve your energy levels.\n\n\nFOCUS MODULE\n\nThe focus module is music designed to help you get more work done.\n\nBuilt around ‘focuscapes,’ environments of sound that help you get in the zone and be productive, backed by the same thorough research we use to create our dreamscapes.\n\nEach focuscape has a ‘focus’ section which gets you into full concentration and a ‘cooldown’ section which brings you back out gently.\n\n\nWHAT MAKES PZIZZ SO MUCH BETTER? \n\n*Simplicity* Sleep at the push of a button! Unlike other sleep solutions, you don’t have to change your behavior, keep a sleep diary, or limit your activities. Just listen to Pzizz, and enjoy incredible sleep. \n\n*No Side Effects* Our only side effect is sleep! Unlike medications or supplements, you’ll never have to worry about adverse effects.\n\n*Variety* Every time you listen to Pzizz it creates a unique session for you. This ensures your brain doesn’t get fatigued from hearing the same things over and over again, and helps maintain effectiveness over time.\n\n*Highly customizable* Adjust sleep duration, volumes, 3D effect, and voice gender for a fully personalized listening experience. Also: integration with Apple Health!\n\n*Clinically Validated* Pzizz is incredibly effective and clinically validated.

This is the test used by the international armies and police departments all around the world to evaluate the physical body conditions. But it is commonly used also among the workout and fitness lovers. Is this the first time using something like this to measure your fitness levels? Then before starting this App read this important information on how the Beep Test came to be and how to use it.\n\nThe Beep Test (aka Bleep Test, Pacer Test, Multistage Fitness Test, 10 or 20m Shuttle Run Test – you name it!) is a fitness assessment that is used to estimate a person's maximum oxygen uptake. It has been used by coaches, school teachers and even royal marines for years! \n\nBut how does it work? Its very simple: it consists in running continuously between two lines placed 20 meters apart from each other, in a gym or a field for example. In order to reach the following stage, you must reach the line before you hear the BEEP.\n\nAt first, the speed will seem quite low. However, as you advance through the stages the beeps will come close together, so make sure you start slowly and steadily without exhausting yourself too early on.\n\nThe Beep Test: Police Military Multi Stage Assessment will help you carry out this cardiovascular fitness test and improve your performances in running and cardio. Just start the timer by pressing the button at the center of the screen, and simply start to run trying to not exceed the beep time. Challenge yourself everyday and let your phone calculate what level you are able to reach. Strive for getting better, and train every day to beat your record on this multi stage physical fitness test.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this fitness testing app, and that it may help you keep tack of your overall level of fitness.

By alerting first aid trained bystanders to local incidents, GoodSAM aims to prevent the irreparable brain and heart damage which all to frequently occurs during a cardiac arrest or traumatic incident. Opening an airway and giving basic life support can radically alter the outcome for these patients. \n\nWhen patients suffer a head injury they often stop breathing although their brain is actually not itself injured. Opening an airway and giving basic life support can radically alter the outcome for these patients. The problem has been finding people who can do this, alerting them and rapidly getting them to the patients.\n\nThere are, of course, thousands of people with such skills; off-duty doctors, nurses, police officers, first aiders are all \"Good Samaritans\" who are simply unaware of the emergency going on next door or outside their building. The Good SAM App uses the technology that can notify these people and help the person in need.\n\nWhat Are The Apps ?\n\nWe are publishing two applications; GoodSAM Alerter and GoodSAM Responder. The GoodSAM Alerter app uses locational services to track the location of a person in need of a help; after a call is triggered we know exactly where the person is located.\nOn the other hand, the GoodSAM Responder app continuously sends locational updates to our server to allow the location of volunteer doctors/first-aiders to be tracked so they can be notified of any emergencies occurring around them. For more information please refer to \"www.goodsamapp.org\".\n\nWhich Countries Are Supported ?\nOur aim is to potentially cover all the large cities around the globe.\n\nOur Apps rely on location services for navigation and position updates.

The mixing of static and dynamic splits helps you improve flexibility effectively and achieve results faster than you think. With just 10 min a day, you’ll get closer and closer to the floor!\n\nProductive stretches for splits in 30 days are suitable for men and women, adults and kids. You can customize your splits training based on your own preferences, no equipment needed.\n\nWhether you want to do a full split for dance, ballet, gymnastics or martial arts, this training will help you get there.\n\nWhy splits?\nSplits have been proven to prevent injuries, increase muscle strength, relieve muscle stiffness and give you better circulation.\n\nImprove your flexibility & balance\nFlexibility and balance are key to reducing the risk of injury during exercise. Splits stretch all your lower body muscles to increase your range of motion.\n\nLoosen your hip flexors\nDue to sitting at a desk all day, most people have extremely tight hip flexors, which can cause pain, especially in your lower back. Splits open up these areas to relieve your muscle tension.\n\nDeeply stretch your legs\nWhen doing splits, your legs will be stretching the whole time.

Myzone also offers amongst the most precise calorie-crunch data on the market, plus the ability to effectively calculate cardio and weight training.\n\nMyzone uniquely rewards effort, while providing a game based platform and social experience that is both inclusive and engaging to all, regardless of athletic ability. As the name suggests, its technology creates bespoke and responsive targets for each individual, to provide personal feedback – hence ‘Myzone’.\nCreating a personal handicap based on your maximum heart rate, it is possible to beat an elite athlete by simply working harder. For example, you might finish behind an elite athlete in an endurance run, but exert greater effort and Myzone makes you the winner – so everyone competes on a level playing field.\n\nMyzone encourages competition with other users through cloud-based challenges via a web-based account and bespoke app. The community aspect of Myzone makes it a Facebook for physical activity. Users can analyze, ‘like’, and comment on each other’s workouts, while the app logs your activity history and even updates you over email. In fact, this is the only system to recognize and notify you when you have attained the World Health Organization’s recommended guidelines for physical activity.\nThe Myzone App allows you to sync your Myzone MZ-3 Physical Activity Belt with your phone meaning you can now see live data and upload stored workouts on your phone. If you prefer to use your MZ-3 with third party fitness apps then your data will still be stored (up to 16 hours) until you sync with your Myzone® app. \n\nThis app integrates with many other platforms, including Apple Health. If you grant permission, we will save your activity calories, height, weight, BMI, BMR and body fat data to Apple Health.\n\n**** Please note that the app will only work if you have a Myzone® Account (you can create an account in the app for free if you don’t have one already) and your tile will only be shown and data uploaded if you have the new Myzone® MZ-3 Physical Activity Belt.”","icon":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/44/b6/11/44b61129-f2aa-733d-a66e-88f6481ae117/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6013"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["AR","EN","FR","DE","IT","JA","KO","PL","PT","RU","ZH","ES","SV","TH","ZH"],"size":"165507072","requiredOsVersion":"10.0","released":"2015-05-17T05:11:15Z","updated":"2020-04-16T09:44:10Z","releaseNotes":"2.32.1\n- Further MZ-Book improvements","version":"2.32.1","price":0,"currency":"GBP","free":true,"developerId":549797901,"developer":"MYZONE (Worldwide) Ltd.","developerUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/developer/myzone-worldwide-ltd/id549797901?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.myzone.org","score":4.67833,"reviews":3917,"currentVersionScore":4.67833,"currentVersionReviews":3917,"screenshots":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/02/db/16/02db162d-7f84-e066-7d57-57570a156420/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/1c/55/3a/1c553a87-28c3-81b9-1d7a-e5139ab2e47d/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/a8/51/2c/a8512c18-185f-98b8-55d6-f39b34c3104d/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/c7/7b/c1/c77bc1d2-d553-96ba-e58f-bc2bdfb8dc37/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPad878-iPad878","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPad856-iPad856","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPhone5-iPhone5","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPad76-iPad76","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPad611-iPad611","iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen","iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPhone5c-iPhone5c","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPad74-iPad74","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPad812-iPad812","iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPad834-iPad834","iPad612-iPad612","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPad71-iPad71","iPad73-iPad73","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","iPad72-iPad72","Watch4-Watch4","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPad75-iPad75","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"]},{"id":990154592,"appId":"au.com.headjam.balanced","title":"Balanced","url":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/balanced/id990154592?uo=4","description":"There are lots of apps out there, but only one Balanced.

Whether it’s yard work or your favorite sport, catch with the kids or CrossFit, PAI helps you add joy to your days and years to your life.\n\nPERSONALIZED TO YOU\nPAI (Personalized Activity Intelligence) helps you understand the health impact of everything you do on your heart and provides you with a personalized goal, designed to improve your heart health.  \n\nThe app translates heart rate and personal profile data (taken from Fitbit and Apple Watch devices) and translates it into a simple score that tells you if you are active enough and provides a weekly goal.  \n\nBACKED BY SCIENCE\nThe Personal Activity Intelligence algorithm was developed by the Nobel Prize-winning Faculty of Medicine at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and scientifically validated using data collected from the HUNT Study, which followed 45,000 people over 25 years. Research studies showed that those who maintained 100 PAI or more over time reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease mortality by an average of 25% and extended their lifespans by an average of 5 years. \n\nYOUR GUIDE TO IMPROVED YOUR HEART HEALTH\nIt’s never too late to start! PAI will give you a personalized plan to get you on the path to improving your heart health - tracking your progress as you go. Start with a goal of 30 PAI and move up to 100 PAI which is the ideal goal to achieve and maintain the best cardiovascular health. \n\nFIND OUT YOUR FITNESS AGE\nPAI takes your profile and combines it with data from your wearable device and calculates your Fitness Age. This is a quick and easy way to understand if your heart health is better or worse than it should be for someone of your age. \n\nMEASURE WHAT MATTERS\nIt’s not the number of steps that count, but how much heart you put into it. That’s why PAI counts all activity - as long as it gets your body moving and your heart pumping. PAI works for all fitness levels too as it’s personalized to your unique makeup. \n\nLearn more about PAI Health at www.paihealth.com.","icon":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/e0/b8/bf/e0b8bfae-c3f7-e36d-ef36-2a628923dcf1/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6013"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"18713600","requiredOsVersion":"11.0","released":"2020-01-13T08:00:00Z","updated":"2020-04-10T16:33:48Z","releaseNotes":"- Bug fixes","version":"1.2.1","price":0,"currency":"GBP","free":true,"developerId":1450296086,"developer":"PAI Health Inc.","developerUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/developer/pai-health-inc/id1450296086?uo=4","score":4,"reviews":4,"currentVersionScore":4,"currentVersionReviews":4,"screenshots":["https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/f1/df/31/f1df31ec-5cea-b0f9-d752-a3851e7d0a27/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/d3/e0/a1/d3e0a150-5dcf-7567-dbf5-6f052bdb29b7/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/e4/14/5b/e4145b7d-e8aa-529a-a536-7a0534f8eb15/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/2e/e3/df/2ee3dfeb-ff41-6dbd-e907-8521f6b37ce8/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/4a/2c/98/4a2c98f1-30ed-6092-a6c2-ae2c581ff279/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/1a/3e/6e/1a3e6e2d-74f8-6aed-bc19-1a949be2c303/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPad878-iPad878","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPad856-iPad856","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPad76-iPad76","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPad611-iPad611","iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen","iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPad74-iPad74","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPad812-iPad812","iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPad834-iPad834","iPad612-iPad612","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPad71-iPad71","iPad73-iPad73","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","iPad72-iPad72","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPad75-iPad75","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"]},{"id":1274924617,"appId":"com.thekineticagroup.moovosity","title":"Moovosity - movement skills","url":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/moovosity-movement-skills/id1274924617?uo=4","description":"Quality movement at home has never been more important.\nWe’re passionate about helping kids realise their potential through the power and joy of movement and activity.

This was our focus; it was the next time we would be together, though sadly it never happened. Julie and I both believe that ‘Angel Sara’ will be there in Paris to meet all who are involved in this event.\n\nOur pilgrimage to bring alive that memory is the basis of ‘Meet you in Paris’. We will travel from Australia to London Bridge to the Eiffel Tower, travelling for eight days by bicycle to the Eiffel Tower, Paris. Throughout our journey we will be carrying our personal letter of hope to be delivered to the people of France. \n\nPlease join us to bring our community and our world together to share unconditional love for all that we have in life.\n\nYours Sincerely\nMark & Julie Wallace”\n\n\nAny questions or feedback?

This App has been extensively validated compared to traditional paper versions tools (more info below)  \n\nThe Interactive Clinics App itself will not share your pain level entry with third parties. Therefore, no one else will have access to your pain level data. \n\n\n—— FUNCTIONALITY ——\n\n\t• Interactive Clinics App is also designed to potentially connect with a website called https://interactiveclinics.com which may provide further meaningful information regarding your exercise level captured while using your iWatch\n\n\t• If you may wish to share your 'pain level' and 'physical activity information' please contact your personal-trainer or allied health professional for more information. This functionality will only be enabled if you consent to link the App with the interactiveclinics.com. In order to link with interactiveclinics.com, please ask your personal-trainer or allied health professional to provide you with the unique '6 digits codes' that needs to be inserted in the 'Link Module' Tab of the App\n\n\n—— PAIN LEVEL ——\n\n\t• Pain Level has been usually recorded by filling the paper Visual Analogue Scale (pVAS) that consists of a 10cm straight line, where 0 represent NO pain and 10 equates to the 'worst possible pain'. Traditionally, the user is simply asked to draw a dot with a pen on the paper line. The value obtained provides an overview of the person's current pain level. The pVAS is a free tool used on a daily basis by health professionals. pVAS been extensively validated as an appropriate outcome measures for assessing pain with children, adolescents and adult. More information about the traditional paper VAS can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale\n\n\t• Our team has developed a modern version of the pVAS, called: electronic Visual Analogue Scale (eVAS). The functionality of the Interactive Clinics App enables the user to capture the pain level directly using the eVAS. On the eVAS a horizontal line is displayed over a white background where the user can insert the level of pain: 0=no pain, 10= worst possible pain. Once the information has been entered, the user can press 'continue' and the App will automatically display a number (ranging from 0 to 10, for example 5.2)\n\n\t• Our research team has successfully conducted a large cross-sectional study comparing the pVAS with the eVAS showing excellent reliability and repeatability compared to the traditional pVAS. In addition, our protocol has also been published and it is publicly available directly on https://www.protocols.io/view/comparison-of-paper-and-electronic-visual-analogue-rrxd57n\n\n\n—— PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ——\n\nThe Interactive Clinics app integrates with Health App and uses HealthKit API's in order to get your physical activity data through your iWatch. It will show your progress in an easy way and will motivate you to achieve your goals.\n\n\n—— NOTES ——\n\n\t• The Interactive Clinics App does NOT provide a medical interpretation of the value recorded in the Pain Level Module\n\t• The Interactive Clinics App itself will NOT provide any type of direct or indirect doctor consultation or any medical related health advice. Also, it does not provide any medical reports that can inform or misinform the users in any aspect of their health\n\t• The Interactive Clinics App itself does NOT provide or share any information with any doctor or anyone else regarding the user progress of any outcome. Only if the user consents to connect with the interactiveclinics.com, then a possible personal-trainer or allied health professional may observe the information that the user willingly decided to share. The personal-trainer or allied health professional can potentially send a short text via push-notification with the aim to motivate the user to meet the daily exercise target\n\nEnjoy!","icon":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/e8/05/d1/e805d125-c17b-9079-5c3e-402562778277/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Medical"],"genreIds":["6013","6020"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"14609408","requiredOsVersion":"9.0","released":"2018-08-09T02:34:10Z","updated":"2019-09-19T00:46:52Z","releaseNotes":"Enjoy connecting your smartwatch with this version and follow up your fitness progression!\nFixed a connectivity bug, physical activity data bug and improved app performance.","version":"1.1.1","price":0,"currency":"GBP","free":true,"developerId":940121093,"developer":"Bit Genoma Digital Solutions SL","developerUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/developer/bit-genoma-digital-solutions-sl/id940121093?uo=4","score":0,"reviews":0,"currentVersionScore":0,"currentVersionReviews":0,"screenshots":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/3f/a1/da/3fa1daa6-b0b9-df3e-0bdc-8d5e218b420c/mzl.obfxoepa.png/392x696bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/30/f6/02/30f6023d-a422-841a-5208-24c8f2c856e1/mzl.gvhquxhj.png/392x696bb.png","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/37/de/ae/37deaea3-aedd-7cde-0a4e-e14ad25531e0/mzl.bdzdlwwm.png/392x696bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/39/07/c3/3907c337-6346-17ea-f493-f168c675b012/mzl.xhbcjrjj.png/392x696bb.png","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/01/a4/60/01a460d4-43cb-4c83-8d22-8bd24043bc00/mzl.xxjapdqu.png/392x696bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/f5/3f/85/f53f85f6-cba4-99a7-7f88-31ee2680380e/mzl.yfpuvqcl.png/392x696bb.png"],"ipadScreenshots":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/70/d3/47/70d347ea-39f4-6bce-c6b7-356c6830e649/mzl.ynxymtph.png/576x768bb.png","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/15/44/51/1544514c-745c-b84c-ddb4-a4b2209835cf/mzl.hpvcutdf.png/576x768bb.png","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/fc/7f/a3/fc7fa36e-71f5-cd34-db62-a40d960c7720/mzl.okvokrzd.png/576x768bb.png","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/2a/52/ca/2a52ca8e-588a-5bdd-6d3d-75629aa094fd/mzl.bfszcdjg.png/576x768bb.png","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/c4/6b/06/c46b063a-01fb-12ce-fe86-7af28880e6a5/mzl.bxodhfjg.png/576x768bb.png","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/be/dc/11/bedc116d-4002-eca0-5b47-8d0cb8b7f6b8/mzl.hmokiado.png/576x768bb.png"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G","iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPad878-iPad878","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPad856-iPad856","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPhone5-iPhone5","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPad76-iPad76","iPad23G-iPad23G","iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPhone4S-iPhone4S","iPad611-iPad611","iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen","iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPhone5c-iPhone5c","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPad74-iPad74","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPad812-iPad812","iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPad834-iPad834","iPad612-iPad612","iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPad71-iPad71","iPad73-iPad73","iPadMini-iPadMini","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","iPad72-iPad72","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","Watch4-Watch4","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","Watch5-Watch5","iPad75-iPad75","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"]},{"id":1439031023,"appId":"com.hinteenx.xperthealth","title":"XpertHealth","url":"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/xperthealth/id1439031023?uo=4","description":"With the XpertHealth app you can conveniently track all your activities.

Programėlės aprašymas lietuvių kalba - apačioje\n\nMotionity is an app that motivates you to be physically active every day. Your goal is to collect at least ten Motionity activity points each day by walking, running, biking or doing many other types of physical activity. By doing so you will improve your health, strengthen your muscles and may even extend your life expectancy as much as 4 years!\n\nWhy did we create Motionity?\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, approximately 3.2 million deaths each year are attributable to insufficient physical activity. Health professionals argue that insufficient levels of physical activity increase the risk of chronic diseases (for example, cancer) and may even lead to a premature death. \n\nMotionity was created to help you to understand whether you are sufficiently physically active every day. Motionity provides you with an easy-to-understand information about your daily physical activity levels and motivates you to be more physically active, if needed.\n\nWhat makes Motionity special?\n\nFirst, Motionity takes into account your physical characteristics while assessing your daily physical activity levels. It is obvious, that a 30-minute walk at a brisk pace is a tough task for some, whereas for others it may be just an another daily thing. For this reason, Motionity, unlike other apps, does not just blindly sum your daily steps. On the contrary - it calculates a relative intensity of each of your daily physical activity events by taking into account your age, sex, height and weight. In this way, you are provided with an accurate and personalized information about your daily physical activity levels.\n\nSecond, Motionity does not use a GPS signal. Unlike other similar apps, instead of using GPS Motionity employs the hardware of your phone to make all the calculations it needs. Thus, Motionity not only ensures your privacy but also saves your phone battery from draining.\n\nThird, Motionity may help you save up to $500. Motionity detects your physical activity as accurately as most smart watches or smart bands on the market, provided that you carry the phone with you. The main difference - Motionity is free! \n\nWe hope that Motionity will help you to become more active, healthier and live longer!\n\nNote. Motionity gets information about your physical activity from a special processor in your mobile phone. After receiving your approval, Motionity receives this information (also known as 'Motion&Fitness' data) and transforms it into the data about your physical activity. Motionity gets information about your physical characteristics (your age, height, sex and weight) directly from you or, after receiving your approval, from the Health app on your phone. The main goal of Motionity is to provide you with an accurate and easy-to-understand information about your daily physical activity levels. However, please take note that Motionity is a tool for information purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. Motionity is intended as a self-help tool so you should contact your health care provider or emergency services if needed.\n\n\n***\n\nLietuviškai:\n\n„Motionity“ - tai mobilioji programėlė, kurios pagalba galite stebėti, ar pakankamai fiziškai judate kiekvieną dieną. Jūsų tikslas - kasdien surinkti bent 10-imt „Motionity“ aktyvumo balų, žyminčių, kad pasiekėte minimalų savo užsibrėžtą kasdienio fizinio judėjimo tikslą. Kasdien surinkdami bent 10-imt „Motionity“ aktyvumo balų tapsite sveikesni ir, anot mokslininkų, savo gyvenimą galite prailginti net iki 4-ių metų!\n\nTam, kad nereikėtų skaičiuoti kiekvieno žingsnio, sukūrėme „Motionity“, kuri jums padės akimirksniu suprasti, ar pakankamai fiziškai judate.

That's why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRACK YOUR WORKOUTS FROM YOUR PHONE OR WATCH\r\n\r\nGet instant insights when you exercise and see real-time stats for your runs, walks, and bike rides.

By alerting first aid trained bystanders to local incidents, GoodSAM aims to prevent the irreparable brain and heart damage which all to frequently occurs during a cardiac arrest or traumatic incident. Opening an airway and giving basic life support can radically alter the outcome for these patients. \r\n\r\nWhen patients suffer a head injury they often stop breathing although their brain is actually not itself injured. Opening an airway and giving basic life support can radically alter the outcome for these patients.

Join us for truly eye-opening meditation sessions, fit for beginners, and seasoned meditators alike.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the modern mind is overstimulated. The purpose of Deep Meditate is to help restore an ancient balance through meditation and sleep. The simple app can help you grow your emotional well-being through deep meditation. You will learn mindfulness techniques, find ways to become calm, cultivate gratitude, and experience deep relaxation.\r\n\r\nThe app is divided into 3 parts to help you take care of your mind:\r\n\r\n- Meditate: To cultivate lasting peace of mind\r\n- Music: To escape from the everyday grind\r\n- Sleep: To get rest & preserve one's sanity\r\n\r\nEach of these sections is there to help you. The purpose of this app is to help you sleep better, experience deeper relaxation, and enjoy life a bit more. Simply open the app, select your meditation theme and press play. Simply sit back, relax, and breathe in the tranquility.\r\n\r\nAnd don’t worry if you have never meditated before. Each meditation is a guided meditation, one that will talk you through each and every step. There are meditations of shorter duration for beginners, as well as longer duration sessions for seasoned meditators looking for a challenge.\r\n\r\nGuided Meditations\r\nThere are 10 distinct meditation suites:\r\n\r\n- Breathing Meditations\r\n- Mindfulness Relaxation\r\n- Muscle Relaxation\r\n- Traditional Meditation\r\n- Mindfulness Meditation\r\n- 10 Minute Meditation\r\n- Meditation for Beginners\r\n- Workplace Meditation\r\n- Visualization Meditation\r\n- Stress & Anxiety Meditation\r\n\r\nCalming Music & Nature Sounds\r\nPut some headphones on, and disappear into a world of environments, or take a quick nap induced by ambient melodies and extremely relaxing music. Our rich catalog of relaxing melodies will help you calm your mind and get rid of any stress. We have over 250 different music compositions and relaxing nature sounds including:\r\n\r\n- Crackling Fire\r\n- Waves On A Rocky Beach\r\n- Gently Lapping Water\r\n- Rainforest\r\n- Lazy Crickets\r\n... and more than 250 such tracks!\r\n\r\nMusic tracks and soundscapes that combine natural sounds and instrumental melodies to form the perfect atmosphere for solo meditation, sleep, or work.\r\n\r\nSleep\r\n\r\n- Sleep Hypnosis Meditation: We've worked with industry-leading hypnosis experts, people whose job it is to help you snooze, to bring top-of-the-class sleep meditations. These meditations are tried and tested to help users get a deep, restful sleep. Simply press play, and you'll be asleep in no time!\r\n\r\n- Sleep Stories: Who says bedtime stories can only be enjoyed by kids? Listen to over 50 sleep stories and wind-downs written especially for adults, designed to help you get that much-needed zZz. With one new sleep story releasing every weekend, you've always got something to look forward to.\r\n\r\nMeditation Timers\r\nThere are two timer types included in Deep Meditate for your unguided sessions.\r\n\r\n- Meditation Timer: Meditating in solitude can be an enlightening experience. But practice makes perfect. A timer helps keep track of time so you don't have to think about it. All timers can be customized by you to have a starting bell, background music, and an ending bell. In the end, the time you meditated for will be added to your progress statistic.\r\n\r\n-Open Ended Timer: Meditate for as long as you wish while the app keeps time. A subtle gong marks the beginning of a session. You may also choose to have the gong sound at intervals, to keep your mind present, and in-the-moment.","descriptionHTML":"Life can be stressful, but meditation isn&#39;t.
